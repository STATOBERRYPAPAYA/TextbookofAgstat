# Probability

Probability is a cornerstone of statistical methods, providing the mathematical framework to quantify and analyze uncertainty. In the diverse and dynamic field of agricultural research, uncertainty often arises in areas such as yield predictions, pest control strategies, and the impact of environmental variables on crop growth. Understanding probability equips researchers and students with the tools to make informed decisions in the face of variability and randomness.

At its core, probability deals with the likelihood of events occurring under specified conditions. From predicting rainfall during a growing season to determining the probability of disease outbreaks in livestock, probability concepts are indispensable for addressing practical challenges in agriculture. This chapter introduces fundamental probability concepts, aiming to bridge theoretical principles with real-world applications relevant to agricultural and social science research.

We begin with the basic definitions and axioms of probability, laying the foundation for understanding random experiments, sample spaces, and events. The chapter progresses to explore key topics such as conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and independence of events.

## Random experiment

A random experiment is a process or procedure that produces an outcome which cannot be predicted with certainty beforehand. The outcome is determined by chance, and the set of all possible outcomes is known as the sample space. Random experiments form the basis of probability theory and are critical for understanding uncertainty in various contexts.

Characteristics of a random experiment include:

Uncertainty of outcome: The result of the experiment cannot be predetermined.

Repeatability: The experiment can be repeated under the same conditions.

Defined sample space: All possible outcomes are known and well-defined.

Some common examples of random experiments used to illustrate probability theory were discussed below:

**Tossing a coin**

Tossing a coin is one of the simplest and most fundamental random experiments used to illustrate the principles of probability. Despite its simplicity, this seemingly mundane activity provides profound insights into random processes and lays the groundwork for understanding more complex probabilistic systems.

When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes:

-   heads ($H$) or

-   tails ($T$)

We say that for an unbiassed coin the probability of the coin landing $H$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of the coin landing $T$ is $\frac{1}{2}$

::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
An unbiased coin is a theoretical concept in probability, referring to a coin designed or assumed to have no preference for either side when tossed, such that the likelihood of landing on heads (H) is exactly the same as landing on tails (T), with each outcome having a probability of 1/2 or 50%. Its characteristics include perfect symmetry, ensuring the coin is balanced without physical imperfections or uneven weight distribution that could influence the result, and equal probability, where each side is equally likely to face upward after a toss. This assumption generally holds under ideal experimental conditions, free from external factors like uneven surfaces or human bias in the tossing technique.

**Throwing dice**

A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, with each face having an equal probability of appearing when the die is rolled under fair conditions. The probability of getting any one of them is $\frac{1}{6}$.

![Two dice](images/dice.png){#fig-dice fig-align="center" style="text-align:center;" width="30%"}

**Playing cards**

A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards, divided into four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, with each suit containing 13 cards. Four suits in playing cards were given in the @fig-suitsincard. The spades suit includes 9 numbered cards from 2 to 10, along with the picture cards ace, king, queen, and jack. Similarly, the hearts, diamonds, and clubs suits each contain 13 cards. Of these 52 cards, 26 are red, consisting of the hearts and diamonds suits, while the other 26 cards are black, comprising the spades and clubs suits. Playing cards can be used to create examples for random experiments, such as drawing a single card from a shuffled deck to determine its specific identity. Other experiments include drawing a card and checking its suit etc. These simple experiments can be easily modified with conditions or repetition, making playing cards a versatile tool for exploring probability and random events.

## Probability

Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur. It quantifies uncertainty and is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. Mathematically, the probability of an event $A$ is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely, and is given by

Probability of an event $A$ happening:

$$P(A)$ = $\frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}}$$ {#eq-probability1}

**Example 10.1**: What is the chances of rolling a "4" with a die ?

**Solution 10.1**: Let the event $A$ = rolling a "4" with a die. Number of ways event $A$ can happen is one, as there is only 1 face with a "4" on it. Total number of outcomes is 6 (there are 6 faces altogether). So using @eq-probability1; probability,$P(A)$ = $\frac{1}{6}$.

**Example 10.2**: There are 5 marbles in a bag: 4 are blue, and 1 is red. What is the probability that a blue marble gets picked?\
**Solution 10.2**: Let the event $A$ = a blue marble gets picked. Number of ways event $A$ can happen is 4 (there are 4 blues). Total number of possible outcomes is 5 (there are 5 marbles in total). So using @eq-probability1; probability,$P(A)$ = $\frac{4}{5}$ = 0.8

**Common terms used**{.underline}

**Outcome:** An outcome is the result of a random experiment, representing a single occurrence or observation. For instance, when rolling a die, the outcomes could include the appearance of 1 dot, 2 dots, and so on.

**Sample space:** The sample space (denoted as $S$) of a random experiment is the set that contains all possible outcomes of that experiment. For example, when tossing a coin, the sample space is $S$ = {H, T}, and when throwing a die, the sample space is $S$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

**Sample point:** A sample point is an individual element of the sample space, representing a single possible outcome. For example, "heads" in a coin toss or the "5 of clubs" in a deck of cards are sample points. In the case of rolling a die, there are six distinct sample points within the sample space.

## Event

An event refers to one or more outcomes of a random experiment. It can represent any subset of the sample space, where the event consists of specific outcomes that are of interest in the context of the experiment. An event can be a single outcome. For example, when tossing a coin, getting a "Tail" is an event that represents just one outcome from the sample space {H, T}. Similarly, rolling a "5" on a die is an event that includes only one specific outcome, 5, from the sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

On the other hand, an event can also include multiple outcomes. For instance, when selecting a "king" from a deck of cards, the event includes any one of the four kings (king of hearts, king of diamonds, king of clubs, king of spades), forming a set of four possible outcomes. Similarly, when rolling an "even number" on a die, the event would encompass the outcomes {2, 4, 6}, which are all the even numbers in the sample space of a die roll. Thus, an event can be a single outcome or a combination of multiple outcomes depending on the context of the experiment.

**Example 10.3**: Ram wants to see how many times a "double" (both dice have same number) comes up when throwing 2 dice.

**Solution 10.3**: The *sample space* is all possible outcomes (36 Sample Points): {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} ... {6,3} {6,4} {6,5} {6,6}. The *event* Ram is looking for is a "double", where both dice have the same number. It is made up of these 6 sample points: {1,1} {2,2} {3,3} {4,4} {5,5} and {6,6}. You can also calculate the probability of the event using @eq-probability1. Probability = $\frac{6}{36}$ = 0.16.

### Types of events

**Independent events**  

Independent events are events where the occurrence of one does not influence the occurrence of another. For instance, consider tossing a coin. If it lands on "heads" three times in a row, the outcome of the next toss remains unaffected by the previous results. The probability of getting "heads" on the next toss is still $\frac{1}{2}$ (or 0.5), just as it is for any fair coin toss. This demonstrates that past outcomes do not influence the probabilities of future events in independent scenarios.

**Dependent events**  

Dependent events are events where the outcome of one event influences the probabilities of subsequent events. For example, consider drawing cards from a deck. The probabilities change as cards are removed from the deck, altering the available outcomes. Initially, the chance of drawing a king on the first card is $\frac{4}{52}$. However, for the second draw, the probabilities depend on the outcome of the first draw. If the first card is a king, only 3 kings remain among the 51 remaining cards, reducing the likelihood of drawing another king to $\frac{3}{51}$. Conversely, if the first card is not a king, all 4 kings remain, making the probability $\frac{4}{51}$. This illustrates how previous outcomes affect probabilities in dependent events.  

::: {.callout-important title="Note"}  

When cards are drawn `with replacement`, each card is returned to the deck after being drawn, so the total number of cards remains constant. This keeps the probabilities unchanged, making the events independent. However, when cards are drawn `without replacement`, the total number of cards decreases after each draw, which alters the probabilities and makes the events dependent.  
:::  

**Mutually exclusive events**  

Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. It is either one event or the other, but not both. For example, turning left or right is mutually exclusive because you cannot do both simultaneously. Similarly, heads and tails in a coin toss, or drawing kings and aces from a deck, are mutually exclusive. However, not all events are mutually exclusive. For instance, kings and hearts are not mutually exclusive because it is possible to have a king of hearts, an outcome that belongs to both categories.  

**Exhaustive events**  

A set of events is called exhaustive if, together, they encompass the entire sample space. For example, when tossing a die, the sample space is $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Consider the events: Event A, which is getting an even number $\{2, 4, 6\}$, and Event B, which is getting an odd number $\{1, 3, 5\}$. These events are exhaustive because, when combined, they include all possible outcomes in the sample space.

**Favourable events**

Favourable events are the outcomes of a random experiment that satisfy the conditions of a specific event. They form a subset of the sample space that aligns with the event's criteria. For example, in rolling a die, if the event is "rolling an even number," the favourable events are $\{2, 4, 6\}$.

**Equally likely events**

Equally likely events are events that have the same theoretical probability of occurring. For example, when tossing a coin, Event A (getting a head) and Event B (getting a tail) are equally likely events because both have an equal probability of occurring.  

## Definitions of probability  
In probability theory, different approaches are used to define and calculate the likelihood of events occurring. These approaches vary depending on the nature of the experiment and the available information. The three primary definitions of probability are mathematical (classical), statistical (empirical), and axiomatic, each offer unique perspectives and methods for determining probabilities. The classical approach is based on equally likely outcomes, the empirical approach relies on experimental data, and the axiomatic approach, developed by A.N. Kolmogorov, is based on a set of foundational principles. Understanding these definitions helps in applying probability theory to various real-world situations, from simple experiments to more complex scenarios.  

### Mathematical/Classical/Priori approach

If an experiment with $n$ exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes, $m$ outcomes are favourable to the happening of an event $E$, the probability $p$ of happening of E is given by

$$P\left( E \right) = p = \ \frac{m}{n}$$

$p$ is termed as probability of success.

#### Example {.unnumbered}

When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes Heads or Tails. Outcomes are exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equally likely.

Consider the event $E$ : getting a head

Probability of event $E$, $p(E)$ is denoted as $p$

$p$ is given by the definition as:

$m$ = number of outcomes are favourable to the happening of event $E$ = 1

$n$ = number of outcomes (Head and Tail) = 2

$$P\left( E \right) = p = \ \frac{m}{n}$$

$$P\left( E \right) = p = \ \frac{1}{2}$$

*i*.*e*. probability of getting a Head is ½

Above definition have following limitations

-   What will happen if the outcomes are not equally likely. For example in tossing of a biased die.

-   Probability cannot be defined if the total cases '*n*' is unknown or tends to infinity. For example; what is the probability of raining tomorrow?

To overcome these limitations, other definitions are given

### Statistical/Empirical approach

The probability '*p*' of happening of E is given by

$$P\left( E \right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{m}{n}$$

where $n$ is the number of times the process (e.g., tossing the die) is performed which tends to infinity, and $m$ is the number of times the outcome '$E$' happens.

Above definition also has some limitations

-   In some cases, the experiment could never in practice be carried out more than once.

-   It leaves open the question of how large $n$ has to be before we get a good approximation.

To overcome these limitations, another approach to probability was introduced by Russian mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov. In this approach no precise definition is given, instead certain axioms or postulates on which probability calculations are based.

### Axiomatic Approach

Whole field of probability theory is based on the following three axioms

1.  Probability of an event, P ($E$) lies between 0 and 1.That is $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$

2.  Probability of entire sample space is 1. That is $P\left( S \right) = 1$

3.  If A and B are mutually exclusive events then probability of occurrence of either A or B denoted by $P(A \cup B)$ shall be given by $P\left( A \cup B \right) = P\left( A \right) + P(B)$

## Some interesting facts on probability {.unnumbered}

-   Probability $p$ of the happening of an event is known as the probability of success and the probability $q$ of the non-happening of the event as the probability of failure.

-   $p$ as well as $q$ are non-negative and cannot exceed unity. *i*.*e*., 0 ≤ $p$ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ $q$ ≤ 1. Thus, the probability of occurrence of an event lies between 0 and 1 \[including 0 and 1\].

-   Probability of an impossible event is 0 and that of a sure event is 1. If $p(A)$ = 1, the event A is certainly going to happen and if $p(A)$ = 0, the event is certainly not going to happen.

-   The number ($m$) of favorable outcomes to an event cannot be greater than the total number of outcomes ($n$).

## Additional Problems {.unnumbered}

> 1.  In a simultaneous toss of two coins, find the probability of (i) getting 2 heads. (ii) exactly 1 head?

**Solution**

Here, the possible outcomes are HH, HT, TH, TT. *i*.*e*., Total number of possible outcomes = 4.

(i)) Number of outcomes favorable to the event (2 heads) = 1 (*i*.*e*.,HH).

$p$(2 heads) = 1/4 .

(ii)) Now the event consisting of exactly one head has two favourable cases, namely HT and TH

$p$(exactly one head) = 2 /4 = 1/ 2

> 2.  In a single throw of two dice, what is the probability that the sum is 9?

**Solution**

The number of possible outcomes is 6 × 6 = 36.

(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)

(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)

(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)

(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)

(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)

(6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)

Event A: sum is 9

four outcomes are there with sum 9, they are (5,4), (6,3), (3,6), (4,5)

Probability (sum is 9) = 4/36= 1/9

> 3.  From a bag containing 10 red, 4 blue and 6 black balls, a ball is drawn at random. What is the probability of drawing (i) a red ball? (ii) a blue ball? (iii) not a black ball?

There are 20 balls in all. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 20

(i)) Number of red balls = 10

$p$(getting a red ball ) = 10/20 = 1/2

(ii)) Number of blue balls = 4

$p$(getting a blue ball ) = 4/20 = 1/5

(iii)) Number of balls which are not black = 14

$p$(not a black ball ) = 14/20 = 7/10

## Event relations

Consider tossing of a die. If A be the event of getting an even number, then the sample points 2, 4 and 6 are favorable to the event A. The remaining sample points 1, 3 and 5 are not favorable to the event A. Therefore, these will occur when the event A will not occur. In an experiment, the outcomes which are not favorable to the event A are called complement of A and are denoted by 'not' A or by A^c^

### Event A or B

Denoted as (A $\cup$ B), spelled as A union B

Let us consider the example of throwing a die. A is an event of getting a multiple of 2 and B be another event of getting a multiple of 3. The outcomes 2, 4 and 6 are favourable to the event A and the outcomes 3 and 6 are favourable to the event B.

*i*.*e*.

A= {2, 4, 6}

B= {3, 6}

Then A ꓴ B = { 2, 3, 4,6}

Again, if A be the event of getting an even number and B is another event of getting an odd number, then

A = { 2, 4, 6 }

B = { 1, 3, 5 }

Then A ꓴ B = {1, 2, 3, 4,5,6}

### Event A and B

Denoted as (A ꓵ B) spelled as A intersection B. On throwing a die in which A is the event of getting a multiple of 2 and B is the event of getting a multiple of 3. The outcomes favorable to A are 2, 4, 6 and the outcomes favorable to B are 3, 6. Here 6 is present in both A and B so here A ꓵ B = 6

```{r intersection, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Venn diagram showing intersection',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/intersection.png"))  
```

## Additive law of Probability

For any two events A and B of a sample space S,

> $p$(AꓴB) = $p$(A)+$p$(B) − $p$(AꓵB)

For mutually exclusive case $p$(AꓵB)=0; in that case $p$(AꓴB )= $p$(A )+$p$(B ).

### Example {.unnumbered}

1.  A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that it is either a spade or a king?

If A denotes the event of drawing a 'spade card'. B denotes the events of drawing a 'king' respectively. The event A consists of 13 sample points, whereas the event B consists of 4 sample points.

$p$(A)= 13/52

$p$(B)= 4/52

$p$( AꓵB) = 1/52

$p$(AꓴB)= $p$(A)+$p$(B) − $p$(AꓵB) = 13/52+4/52-1/52 = 4/13

2.  In a single throw of two dice, find the probability of a total of 9 or 11.

Let the events A= a total of 9 and B= a total of 11.

Events are mutually exclusive A ꓵ B = 0

Now $p$(A) = $p [(3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3)] = 4 /36$

$p$(B) = $p[(5, 6), (6, 5)] = 2 /36$

Thus, $p(AꓴB) = 4/36 +2/36 = 6/36 = 1/6$

## Multiplication law of probability

If A and B are independent events, then

$p$(AꓵB) = $p$(A). $p$(B)

It is called as the Multiplication law of probability

3.  A die is tossed twice. Find the probability of a number greater than 4 on each throw.

Let us denote by A, the event 'a number greater than 4' on first throw. B be the event 'a number greater than 4' in the second throw. Clearly A and B are independent events. In the first throw, there are two outcomes, namely, 5 and 6 favourable to the event A.

∴ $p$(A) =2/6 = 1/3

Similarly in the second throw, there are two outcomes, namely, 5 and 6 favourable to the event A.

∴ $p$(B) = 2/6 = 1/3

Hence, $p$(A and B) = $p$(AꓵB) = $p$(A).$p$(B) = 1 /3 ×1 /3 = 1/9

## Probability using combinations {.unnumbered}

Knowledge of combinations can be applied to find total number of possible outcomes.

^n^*C*~r~$= \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$

For example ^3^*C*~2~$= \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1(1)} = 3$

Now let us see with example how this is used in probability

A bag contains 3 red, 6 white and 7 blue balls. What is the probability that two balls drawn are white and blue?

Total number of balls = 3 + 6 + 7 = 16

Out of 16 balls, 2 balls can be drawn in ^16^*C*~2~ ways

*i*.*e*. ^16^*C*~2~ = 120.

Out of 6 white balls, 1 ball can be drawn in ^6^*C*~1~ ways and out of 7 blue balls, one can be drawn is ^7^*C*~1~ ways. Since each of the former case is associated with each of the later case, therefore total number of favorable cases is ^6^*C*~1~ × ^7^*C*~1~

Therefore required probability= (^6^*C*~1~ × ^7^*C*~1~) / ^16^*C*~2~ = 42/120 = 7/20

Find the probability of getting both red balls, when from a bag containing 5 red and 4 black balls, two balls are drawn

Total number of balls = 9

Out of 9 balls, 2 balls can be drawn in ^9^C~2~ ways

No of ways both are red balls can be taken = ^5^C~2~

Hence $p$(both red balls ) = ^5^C~2~ / ^9^C~2~ = 5/18
