    "text": "For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham M., whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nA special thanks to Jithin Chandran, Gaatha Prasad, Anjana Biwas T., and Varsha H. for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P. Gopinath\nHead\nDepartment of Agricultural Statistics\nCollege of Agriculture, Vellayani\n2 December 2024",

    "text": "1.1 The word “statistics”\nStatistics is the science of understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data. It plays a crucial role in making informed decisions across various fields, from agriculture to medicine, economics to environmental studies. This chapter serves as an entry point into the fascinating world of statistics, introducing you to its basic concepts and practical applications.\nWe begin by exploring the origins and definitions of statistics, emphasizing its relationship with mathematics and its distinct role in solving real-world problems. From there, we focus on the importance of data—the raw material of statistics—examining its types and how it is collected, organized, and analyzed.\nThe chapter also covers essential concepts such as population and sample, variables and constants, and the different types of variables. These concepts form the building blocks for understanding how statistical studies are designed and conducted.\nFinally, we introduce frequency distributions—an indispensable tool for summarizing and interpreting data. Topics such as construction of frequency distributions, grouped and cumulative frequency distributions, and relative frequency will help you make sense of data and uncover underlying patterns.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the core principles of statistics, setting the stage for deeper exploration and advanced applications in later chapters. The concepts presented here are largely based on the works of (Goon and Dasgupta 1983) and (Gupta and Kapoor 1997)\nThe term statistics originates from the Neo-Latin word statisticum collegium, meaning “council of state,” and the Italian word statista, meaning “statesman” or “politician.” The German term Statistik emerged in the early 18th century and initially referred to the “collection and classification of data,” particularly data used by governments and administrative bodies. This usage was introduced by the German scholar Gottfried Achenwall in 1749, who is often credited as the founder of modern statistics.\nIn 1791, Sir John Sinclair introduced the term Statistik into English through his publication of the “Statistical Account of Scotland”(Ball 2004), a comprehensive 21-volume work. This marked the beginning of the use of the term statistics in English to describe the systematic collection and analysis of data. Later, in 1845, Francis G.P. Neison an actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office published Contributions to Vital Statistics, the first book to include the word “statistics” in its title, focusing on actuarial and demographic data. These developments laid the foundation for statistics as a discipline, evolving from statecraft to a broader scientific approach to data analysis and interpretation.",

    "text": "1.2 Statistics and mathematics\nMathematics and statistics, while closely related, serve distinct purposes and operate on fundamentally different principles. Mathematics can be thought of as a well-organized library, where everything follows strict rules and logical paths. Once a theorem is proven in mathematics, it remains universally true, leaving little room for ambiguity or change. It is a deductive science, relying on precise axioms and logical reasoning to arrive at exact and unchanging results.\nStatistics, however, operates in a different realm. It deals with real-world data, which is often messy, unpredictable, and influenced by numerous uncontrolled factors. Statistics is more like an open field, where methods and approaches must adapt to the variability of data. Unlike the certainty of mathematics, statistics uses inductive reasoning to analyze data, account for randomness, and make decisions or predictions under uncertainty. This flexibility is essential because real-world phenomena, especially in fields like biology, are rarely as neat and predictable as mathematical constructs.\nIn biological sciences, we study complex systems such as plants, animals, and ecosystems, where exact outcomes are rarely achievable. These systems are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which cannot be precisely measured or controlled. This is where the concept of the error term becomes important. The error term represents the difference between observed and predicted values in a statistical model, accounting for the inherent variability and uncertainty in biological phenomena.\nStatisticians embrace this uncertainty, developing mathematical models that approximate reality as closely as possible. Unlike mathematicians, whose focus is on achieving perfect precision, statisticians aim to draw meaningful insights from imperfect and variable data. In the study of biological systems, the goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.\nThus, while mathematics seeks absolute certainty, statistics accepts variability and uncertainty as fundamental characteristics of the real world. By acknowledging and incorporating these uncertainties, statisticians provide valuable tools to study and explain complex biological phenomena, making statistics an indispensable discipline for understanding the complexities of nature.",

Think of data as the building blocks that form the foundation for understanding the world around us. It’s the raw material from which we extract patterns, trends, and conclusions that help us make better decisions.\nIn today’s fast-paced world, data is more important than ever. From predicting weather patterns to optimizing business strategies, data is at the heart of nearly every advancement. Without data, we’re left with guesswork—making it impossible to understand complex systems or make informed decisions.\nHere are some examples of data in action:\n\nNumber of farmers in a village: Understanding this helps policymakers make decisions about agricultural development and rural economics.\nRainfall over a period of time: This data is crucial for predicting crop yields, planning irrigation, and managing water resources.\nArea under paddy crop in a state: This informs agricultural policies, resource allocation, and even global food supply chains.\n\nAs you can see, data isn’t just a collection of numbers; it’s the key to solving real-world problems and shaping the future. In the hands of skilled statisticians, data has the power to unlock insights that can improve lives, drive innovation, and guide decisions at every level.",

It supports decision-making by presenting facts in an organized manner, aids in the formulation of effective policies, facilitates comparisons, and assists in making forecasts. By applying appropriate statistical methods, researchers can draw valid conclusions from experiments.\nApplications of statistics: Statistics has become an integral part of almost every field of human activity. It is indispensable in areas such as administration, business, economics, research, banking, insurance, and more. Its ability to quantify and analyze data makes it an essential tool across industries.\nCommon limitations of statistics: Statistical methods are applicable only when there is variability in the data being studied. Statistics focuses on the analysis of groups or aggregates, rather than individual data points. The results derived from statistical analysis are often approximate and subject to uncertainty. Statistics is sometimes misapplied or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nAs statisticians, we believe that the power of statistics knows no bounds. It’s a tool that, when applied correctly, can unlock insights from any dataset. While the limitations listed above are commonly found in textbooks and curricula across SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), I believe these are more about guiding students on the appropriate use of statistics rather than presenting true constraints. With the right methodology and approach, statistics can be applied in any situation to derive valuable insights and support sound decision-making.",

It will take us a long time to measure the height of all students of the college, so we may select 20 of the students and measure their height (in cm). Suppose we obtain the measurements like this :\n149, 156, 148, 161, 159, 143, 158, 152, 164, 171, 157, 152, 163,\n158, 151, 147, 157, 146, 153, 159.\nIn this study, we are interested in the height of all students in the college. The set of height of all students in the college is called the population of this study. The set of 20 height, H = {149, 156, 148, …, 153, 159}, is a sample from this population.\nPopulation\nIn statistics, a population refers to the entire collection of elements, individuals, or objects that possess a particular characteristic and are the subject of a statistical study. It encompasses all possible observations or measurements that could be included in the analysis. For example, a population could be all the students in a university, all the trees in a forest, or all the farms in a region. The population provides the complete set of data from which conclusions can be drawn.\nSample\nA sample is a subset of a population selected for the purpose of conducting a statistical analysis. It represents a smaller group drawn from the population, ideally chosen to reflect its characteristics. Samples are used to estimate population parameters when it is impractical or impossible to collect data from the entire population. The key to a good sample is that it should be representative of the population to allow valid inferences to be made.\nPopulation parameter\nA population parameter is a numerical characteristic or value that describes an aspect of an entire population. It is a fixed (constant), often unknown value that represents the true measurement of a specific attribute for every member of the population. Common population parameters include the population mean, population variance, and population proportion. Since it is usually impractical or impossible to measure the entire population, parameters are often estimated using sample data.",

Unlike variables, constants retain the same value throughout the study. Examples of constants include:\n\nMathematical values such as pi (\\(\\pi\\)), which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (\\(\\pi\\) = 3.14159…), and e, the base of the natural logarithms (e = 2.71828).",

    "text": "1.8 Types of variables\nQuantitative variables\nA quantitative variable is one that can be expressed in numerical terms and takes values that are measurable. Examples of quantitative variables include the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, the number of schools in a country, plant height, crop yield, panicle length, and temperature. Quantitative variables can be further classified into two categories: discrete and continuous.\nDiscrete variables\nDiscrete variables are variables that can only take a finite or countable number of distinct values. They are often whole numbers and can be counted. For instance, the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, or the number of schools in a country are all discrete variables.\nSince discrete variables represent countable quantities, they can only take specific, separate values, such as 0, 1, 2, etc. For example, the number of daily hospital admissions is a discrete variable because it can only take whole number values like 0, 1, or 2, but not fractional values like 1.8 or 3.96.\nContinuous variables\nContinuous variables, on the other hand, are variables that can take any value within a given range or interval and can be measured. These variables do not have distinct gaps or interruptions in their possible values. For example, plant height, yield, temperature, and panicle length are continuous variables because they can be measured to a high degree of precision, such as 5.5 cm, 5.8 cm, or any value within a relevant range. Continuous variables can assume an infinite number of possible values within a given range, making them different from discrete variables.\nCategorical variables\nA categorical variable is a type of variable where the data is divided into distinct categories that do not have a numerical value. For example, marital status (single, married, widowed), employment status (employed, unemployed), or religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others) are examples of categorical variables. These variables are often referred to as qualitative variables, as they describe qualities or characteristics rather than measurable quantities.\nUnlike quantitative variables, categorical variables cannot be measured or counted in the traditional sense. Instead, they classify data into specific groups or categories.",

    "section": "1.9 Measurement scales",
    "text": "1.9 Measurement scales\nVariables can be classified into four distinct levels of measurement scales each representing a different way of organizing and interpreting data. These four levels are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\nNominal scale\nThe nominal scale is the most basic level of measurement and applies to categorical (qualitative) variables. Data measured on the nominal scale consist of categories that are distinct but have no inherent order or ranking. The categories are simply used for labeling or naming objects or groups. For example, gender (male, female), blood group (A, B, AB, O), and marital status (single, married, divorced) are all nominal variables. In the nominal scale, arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, cannot be performed on the data.\nOrdinal scale\nThe ordinal scale also applies to qualitative data, but with an important distinction: the data on the ordinal scale are ordered. This means that the categories have a specific rank or order, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or meaningful. For example, the grades given in a class (excellent, good, fair, poor) are ordinal, where “excellent” is ranked higher than “good,” and “good” is ranked higher than “fair,” and so on. However, the difference between “excellent,” and “good” is not numerically defined, making the exact magnitude of the difference unclear. Ordinal data allows us to say that one value is greater or lesser than another, but it does not allow for the measurement of exact differences.\nInterval scale\nThe interval scale is used for quantitative (numerical) data, and it provides more information than the nominal or ordinal scales. On the interval scale, the data points are ordered, and the differences between them are meaningful and measurable. However, the interval scale does not have a true zero point. This means that while we can measure the difference between values, we cannot make statements about ratios between them. An example of an interval scale is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. For instance, if the temperature in two cities is 20°C and 30°C, we can say that the temperature in the second city is 10°C higher. However, we cannot say that the second city is “twice as hot” as the first city, because the zero point (0°C) does not represent the absence of temperature.\nRatio scale\nThe ratio scale is the highest level of measurement and applies to quantitative data. It shares the properties of the interval scale—ordered data with measurable differences between values—but it also has a meaningful zero point. This true zero point represents the total absence of the quantity being measured. With the ratio scale, not only can we measure differences between values, but we can also compute meaningful ratios. For example, weight is measured on the ratio scale. A weight of 60 kg is twice as much as a weight of 30 kg, and a weight of 0 kg indicates the complete absence of weight. Similarly, temperature measured on the Kelvin scale is an example of a ratio scale, where 0 Kelvin represents absolute zero, the complete absence of heat.\nIn summary, the key distinctions between these measurement scales are:\n\nNominal: Categories without any order.\nOrdinal: Ordered categories without consistent differences.\nInterval: Ordered data with meaningful differences, but no true zero.\nRatio: Ordered data with meaningful differences and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Classification of variables",

    "text": "1.10 Collection of data\nThe process of collecting data is the foundational step in any statistical investigation or research study. Data can be gathered for an entire population or for a sample drawn from it. Typically, data collection is performed on a sample basis, especially when studying large populations. Collecting data is a challenging task, requiring skill and precision. The person responsible for gathering the data, known as the enumerator or investigator, must be well-trained to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. The individuals or groups providing the information are referred to as the respondents.\n\n1.10.1 Types of data\nData collection can be categorized into two main types based on the source from which the data is derived:\n\nPrimary Data\nSecondary Data\n\nPrimary data\nPrimary data refer to first-hand, original data that are collected directly by the researcher or an organization for a specific purpose. These data have not been processed or analyzed previously and are considered the most authentic form of data. Primary data are typically gathered through surveys, interviews, experiments, or observations, and they represent a direct reflection of the phenomena being studied.\nExample: Population census data collected by the government are considered primary data. These are collected directly from individuals by government authorities for the purpose of census enumeration and demographic analysis.\nSecondary data\nSecondary data refer to data that have already been collected, processed, and published by other organizations or researchers for a different purpose. These data may have undergone some degree of analysis or treatment before being made available for new studies. Secondary data are often more convenient to use, as they are readily accessible, but they may not always perfectly suit the specific needs of the researcher.\nExample: An economic survey of a country, such as reports from the Bureau of Statistics or other governmental agencies, is an example of secondary data. These data were originally collected for purposes such as policy analysis or economic planning, and now can be used for additional research.\nThe distinction between primary and secondary data lies primarily in their origin and the process of collection. Primary data are first-hand, original data collected directly from a single source by the researcher for a specific purpose. These data are considered pure as they have not undergone any prior statistical treatment. In contrast, secondary data are obtained from existing sources or agencies and have been previously collected and processed for different purposes. They are not considered pure as they have undergone some form of statistical treatment. While primary data are original and collected for the first time, secondary data are pre-existing and gathered from other sources. Both types of data have their respective advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on the research objectives, availability of resources, and the nature of the study.",

These investigators engage with individuals, asking questions and filling out questionnaires based on the responses. This method is widely used by organizations for larger data collection efforts.\nCollection through questionnaire\nResearchers distribute questionnaires to local representatives or agents who collect data based on their own experience and observations. While this method is relatively quick, it typically provides only a rough estimate of the information.\nThrough the phone\nData is gathered by contacting individuals via telephone/mobile phone. This method is fast and allows for accurate information to be collected efficiently, making it suitable for studies that require a broad reach but still need reliable data.",

The data, presented in this form in which it was collected, is called raw data.\n0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 5,\n5, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 0, 5, 4,\n2, 4, 4, 4, 1\nIt can be seen that, the minimum and the maximum numbers of fruits per branch are 0 and 5, respectively. Apart from these numbers, it is impossible, without further careful study, to extract any exact information from the data. But by breaking down the data into the form below\n\n\n\nFrequency distribution table\n\n\nNow certain features of the data become apparent. For instance, it can easily be seen that, most of the branches selected have four fruits because number of branches having 4 fruits is 7. This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data. The above table is called a frequency table or a frequency distribution. It is so called because it gives the frequency or number of times each observation occurs. Thus, by finding the frequency of each observation, a more intelligible picture is obtained.\n\n1.13.1 Construction\nIn this section, we will discuss the process of constructing a frequency distribution. Follow the steps below. This method helps to clearly visualize the frequency of each observation, ensuring that the total frequency adds up to the total number of observations.\n\nList all values of the variable in ascending order of magnitude.\nForm a tally column, that is, for each value in the data, record a stroke in the tally column next to that value.

    "text": "1.14 Grouped frequency distribution\nData below gives the plant height of 20 paddy varieties, measured to the nearest centimeters.\n109, 107, 129, 122, 118, 110, 124, 146, 138, 121,\n115, 132, 131, 139, 142, 134, 143, 144, 127, 116\nIt can be seen that the minimum and the maximum plant height are 107 cm and 144 cm, respectively. A frequency distribution giving every plant height between 107 cm and 144 cm would be very long and would not be very informative. The problem is to overcome by grouping the data into classes.\nIf we choose the classes\n100 – 109\n110 – 119\n120 – 129\n130 – 139\n140 – 149\nwe obtain the frequency distribution given below:\n\n\n\nGrouped Frequency distribution table\n\n\nAbove table gives the frequency of each group or class; it is therefore called a grouped frequency table or a grouped frequency distribution. Using this grouped frequency distribution, it is easier to obtain information about the data than using the raw data. For instance, it can be seen that 14 of the 20 paddy varieties have plant height between 110 cm and 139 cm (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.\nIt should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution does not give us the exact plant height of the paddy varieties. Thus the individual plant height of the paddy varieties are lost in our effort to obtain an overall picture.\n\n1.14.1 Terminologies\nClass limits\nThe intervals into which the observations are put are called class intervals. The end points of the class intervals are called class limits. For example, the class interval 100 – 109, has lower class limit 100 and upper class limit 109.\nContinuous classes\nContinuous classes are intervals where the class limits represent a continuous range of values, with no gaps between the intervals.\nExample: If the class intervals are 10 − 20, 20−30, 30−40, and so on, there are no gaps between them, and all values within these ranges are included seamlessly.\nDiscontinuous classes\nDiscontinuous classes are intervals where gaps exist between the class limits. In such cases, class boundaries are used to close the gaps and ensure continuity.\nExample:\nIf the class intervals are 10 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39, and so on, there is a gap between the end of one interval and the start of the next. The actual range of each interval is defined using class boundaries, which is explained below.\nClass boundaries\nThe raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest centimeters. Thus, a plant height of 109.5cm would have been recorded as 110cm, a plant height of 119.4 cm would have been recorded as 119cm, while a plant height of 119.5 cm would have been recorded as 120 cm. It can therefore be seen that, the class interval 110 – 119, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 109.5 cm and less than 119.5 cm. The numbers 109.5 and 119.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 110 – 120. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:\n\n\n\nClass boundary and class limits\n\n\nNote:\nNotice that the lower class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)th class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, …). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (110 + 109) /2 = 109.5 and (130 + 129)/2 = 129.5 respectively.\nIt can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)th class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, …). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class interval is (139 + 140)/2 = 139.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor continuous classes, class limits and boundaries are the same because there are no gaps between intervals. However, for discontinuous classes, boundaries are important as they close gaps and ensure every value belongs to one class.\n\n\nClass mark\nThe mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as follows: class mark = (120+129)/2 = (119.5 + 129.5)/2 = 124.5.\nClass width\nFor continuous classes:\nThe class width is the difference between the upper and lower class limits of a class interval. Since the class limits and boundaries are the same for continuous classes, the width can also be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower or upper class limits.\nFor discontinuous classes:\nThe class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval. For discontinuous classes, class boundaries are used to account for gaps, and the width can also be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower or upper class boundaries.\nNote: \nIn the grouped frequency table above with discontinuous classes, the width of the second class interval is calculated as |110 - 119| = 9. It can be observed that the width is the same for all classes. This result can also be obtained by taking the numerical difference between the lower class boundaries of the second and third class intervals.\n\n\n1.14.2 Construction\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nStep 3. Set up the individual class limits\nStep 4. Tally the items into the classes\nStep 5. Count the number of items in each class\nConsider the example where an agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows\n9, 16, 13, 7, 8, 4, 18, 10, 17, 18,\n9, 12, 5, 9, 9, 16, 1, 8, 17, 1, 10, 5, 9, 11, 15, 6, 14, 9, 1, 12,\n5, 16, 4, 16, 8, 15, 14, 17\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use\nH.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number of classes. \\[\\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}.\\mathbf{\\log}\\mathbf{N}\\] Number of classes should be greater than calculated k.\nIn our example N=38, so k= (1+3.322)×log(38) = (1+3.322)×1.5797 = 6.24 = approx 7\nSo the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24 i.e.\\(\\ k^{'}\\) =7\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nGenerally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. C= | max − min|/ k. Class width \\(C^{'}\\)should be greater than calculated C. For this example, C = | 18− 1|/6.24 = 2.72, so approximately class width \\(C^{'} =\\) 3 (Note that k used here is the calculated value using Sturges formula not the approximated).\nStep 3. To set up the individual class limits, we need to find the lower limit only\n\\[L = min - \\frac{C^{'} \\times k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}\\]\nwhere, C and k here are final approximated class width and number of classes respectively in our example, \\(L = 1 - \\frac{(3 \\times 7) - (18 - 1)}{2}\\) = 1-2 = -1; since there is no negative values in data = 0. Final frequency table will be as shown in Table 1.1\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Frequency distribution table\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n3\n\n\n3-6\n5\n\n\n6-9\n5\n\n\n9-12\n9\n\n\n12-15\n5\n\n\n15-18\n9\n\n\n18-21\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is continuous, so “4 cm” means the actual value could have been anywhere from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.",

For example, in the above table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9 leaves (i.e. 3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency table or cumulative frequency distribution.\nCumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than Cumulative Frequency (LCF) and Greater than Cumulative Frequency(GCF). LCF is the number of values less than a specified value. GCF is the number of observations greater than a specified value.\nThe specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits of the classes.

When the planes returned from combat, they were covered in bullet holes. Naturally, the engineers assumed they should add armor to the most damaged areas to make the planes more resilient. It seemed like common sense—but then came a surprising twist. Abraham Wald, a brilliant statistician, was called in to analyze the problem. He noticed something others had missed. The planes being studied were the ones that survived the missions. The missing data—the planes that never made it back, held the key to solving the puzzle. Wald reasoned that the areas with no damage on the returning planes were likely the most critical: hits in these areas would have brought the planes down, leaving no data behind.\nWald’s insight transformed how decisions were made, leading to smarter strategies that saved countless lives. This story is a powerful reminder of the importance of statistics not just in analyzing what’s visible but in understanding what’s missing. It’s a perfect example of how data, combined with critical thinking, can uncover hidden truths and drive impactful decisions. This revolutionary application of statistics eventually led to the birth of operations research, a field that continues to solve complex problems in diverse areas today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the Samurai.”\n- Jonathan Rosenberg, former Google SVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBall, Philip. 2004.

Reliable and timely information is vital for planners and policymakers to develop effective agricultural policies and make informed decisions on procurement, storage, public distribution, imports, exports, and other related matters. As such, the collection and management of agricultural statistics hold significant importance.\nThis chapter provides an overview of the system for collecting agricultural statistics in India. While agriculture is a state subject, agricultural statistics fall under the concurrent list, resulting in a decentralised system. State Governments, through their State Agricultural Statistics Authorities (SASAs), play a central role in collecting and compiling agricultural statistics at the state level. At the national level, the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, is responsible for compiling the data. Other key agencies involved include the National Statistical Office (NSO) and the State Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DESs).\nCrop statistics comprise two key components: the area sown and the average yield.\nWhile area estimates are derived from land revenue systems, yield estimates are obtained through crop estimation surveys.",

The General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES) covers 65 crops, including 51 food crops and 14 non-food crops. Approximately 9 lakh CCEs are carried out annually in India to estimate the yield of key crops such as rice, maize, bajra, groundnut, and sugarcane. These experiments are conducted systematically to ensure accurate and reliable yield data for principal crops.\n\n\n\nSampling design under General Crop Estimation Survey\n\n\nFinal estimates of crop production are calculated using area figures obtained through complete enumeration and yield rates derived from crop-cutting experiments. These estimates become available only after the harvest. However, to support timely decision-making, the Government requires advance production estimates.\nThe Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES), under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, provides advance estimates of crop area and production for key food and non-food crops such as food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane, and fibres. These estimates are issued in four stages:\n\nFirst forecast: Mid-September\n\nSecond forecast: January\n\nThird forecast: Late March\n\nFourth forecast: Late May\n\nIn addition to these forecasts, Final Estimates of crop area and production are published in December. Subsequently, Fully Revised Estimates for all-India crop statistics are released in December of the following crop year.\nAdditionally, information on the structure and characteristics of the agricultural sector is gathered through the Agricultural Census.",

It provides essential information about operational holdings, including their number, area, land use, cropping patterns, and input usage, down to the lowest geographical levels such as villages, tehsils (sub-districts), and districts. This census serves as a statistical framework for planning and conducting future agricultural surveys.\nInitiated in 1970-71, the Agricultural census is conducted every five years by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in collaboration with State and Union Territory administrations. In states with land records, the number and area of operational holdings are collected through complete enumeration, while detailed data on the characteristics of operational holdings are gathered on a sample basis.\nTo date, eleven Agricultural censuses have been conducted, covering the reference years 1970-71, 1976-77, 1980-81, 1985-86, 1990-91, 1995-96, 2000-01, 2005-06, 2010-11, 2015-16 and 2020-21. The reference period for each census corresponds to the agricultural year, spanning from July to June.\nThe data derived from the Agricultural census plays a crucial role in policy formulation, resource allocation, and the overall development of the agricultural sector in India.\nAdditional data pertaining to various sectors can be obtained from the sources listed in the Appendix 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Insights\n\n\n\n“Mahalanobis and statistical planning in India”\nIn post-independence India, statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis played a key role in shaping the country’s economic planning. He developed statistical methods to guide the allocation of resources in India’s Five-Year Plans. Mahalanobis introduced the Mahalanobis Distance, a method for analyzing multi-dimensional data, and created the Input-Output Model to understand how different sectors of the economy interacted. His work, especially in the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1956), helped optimize resource use and industrial growth. Mahalanobis’ contributions laid the foundation for using statistics in economic policy-making, which continues to guide India’s development.

    "text": "3.5 Stem and leaf plot\nA stem and leaf plot is a graphical device useful for representing a relatively small set of data that takes numerical values. To construct a stem and leaf plot, we partition each measurement into two parts: the stem (the leading digits) and the leaf (the trailing digits). This method retains the exact value of each observation, unlike a frequency distribution. It also clearly shows the distribution of data within each group. A stem and leaf plot conveys similar information as a histogram, with the added benefit of retaining individual data points. It provides insights into the range, concentration of measurements, and symmetry of the data.\nConsider the example:\n12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 26, 30, 31, 37, 42, 45.\nThe stem and leaf plot for this data is shown Figure 3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Stem and leaf plot\n\n\n\nA stem-and-leaf plot is not only useful for small data sets but can also effectively represent larger sets of numerical data. For instance, consider the monthly income of 50 employees in a company:\n19710, 24096, 23618, 26490, 25626, 24653, 24297, 23609, 19120, 25942, 23591, 27302, 29569, 25332, 29396, 20725, 25202, 20763, 30556, 21961, 22910, 21826, 21547, 21015, 19825, 24124, 22275, 26127, 24297, 20564, 26943, 26627, 23602, 24585, 25725, 24322, 23198, 25590, 23366, 23313, 22840, 25514, 24959, 23194, 21337, 26030, 27215, 19260, 27467, 29737.\nThe corresponding stem-and-leaf plot for this data, shown in Figure 3.7, lists the leaves in increasing order under their respective stems. The proper choice of stems is crucial as it organizes the data effectively, revealing patterns and distribution with clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Stem and leaf plot of 5 digit data\n\n\n\nConsider a different dataset representing the percentage of adults with a college degree in 20 cities.\n48.5, 53.2, 42.1, 65.4, 70.3, 38.7, 55.9, 47.3, 59.2, 33.5, 45.6, 62.8, 50.1, 41.3, 36.2, 43.7, 39.8, 66.4, 58.1, 31.2.\nThe stem and leaf plot for this data is shown in Figure 3.8.

There are three types of bar charts, and these are simple bar charts, component bar charts and grouped bar charts.\nSimple bar chart\nIn a simple bar chart, the height (or length) of each bar is equal to the value of category in the y-axis it represents. Table 3.5 presents hypothetical data on coconut production across five districts of Kerala for a specific year.

In this chapter, we shift our focus to statistical measures that describe the characteristics of a dataset.\nOne key aspect of data analysis is identifying a single value that represents the overall dataset. This is where measures of central tendency come into play. These are summary statistics that capture the center or typical value of a dataset, providing a concise numerical summary.\nThere are five commonly used averages: mean, median, and mode, collectively referred to as simple averages, and geometric mean and harmonic mean, known as special averages. In addition to these, there are positional averages, such as quartiles, deciles, and percentiles, which are determined based on the position of values within an ordered dataset. These measures provide insights into the central value and distribution of the data, making them fundamental tools for understanding and interpreting data patterns.\nIn this section, we will focus on simple averages, with a detailed discussion on positional averages and special averages following later.\nRequisites of a good measure of central tendency:\nThe main objectives of measure of central tendency:\nThis is what people usually intend when they say “average”. Arithmetic mean or simply the mean of a variable is defined as the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. Mean of set of numbers \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) is denoted as \\(\\overline{x}\\).

    "text": "4.4 Median of ungrouped frequency distribution\nThe median is the middle number in an ordered set of data. In a frequency table, the observations are already arranged in an ascending order. We can obtain the median by looking for the value in the middle position.\nOdd number of observations\nWhen the number of observations (n) is odd, then the median is the value at the \\(\\left( \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}\\) positional value. For that we use less than cumulative frequency.\nExample 4.7: The Table 4.7 shows the frequency of the score obtained in a mathematics quiz. Find the median score.\n\n\n\nTable 4.7: Score obtained in a mathematics quiz\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nFrequency\n3\n4\n7\n6\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 4.7\nTotal frequency = 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 23 (odd number). Since the number of scores is odd, the median is at \\(\\left( \\frac{23 + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}} =\\) 12th position.\n\n\n\nTable 4.8: Less than cumulative frequency of the scores in mathematics quiz\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nFrequency\n3\n4\n7\n6\n3\n\n\nLess than cumulative frequency\n3\n7\n14\n20\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find out the 12th position, we use less than cumulative frequencies in Table 4.8 which helps us track how many values are less than or equal to each score. In the table, the less than cumulative frequency for the score 0 is 3 (meaning the first 3 values are 0), for the score 1 is 7 (meaning the first 7 values are 0 and 1), and for the score 2 is 14 (meaning the first 14 values are 0, 1, and 2). If we list the data in order, it would look like this: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. (no need to list, this is just for reader’s understanding, less than cumulative frequency is enough).\nNow, we need to find where the 12th value falls. The 12th value is between the 7th and 14th values, so based on less than cumulative frequency it is clear that 12th value is 2. So the median is 2.\nEven number of observations\nWhen the number of observations is even, then the median is the average of \\({\\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right)^{th}\\text{and}\\left( \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\right)}^{\\text{th}}\\) position values.\nExample 4.8: The Table 4.9 is a frequency table of the marks obtained in a competition.

Since the number of scores is even, the median is at the average of the values in \\({\\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right)^{th} = 25\\ and\\ \\left( \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\right)}^{\\text{th}} = 26\\) positions. To find out the 25th position and 26th position, we add up the frequencies as shown:\n\n\n\nTable 4.10: Less than cumulative frequency of marks obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nFrequency\n11\n9\n5\n10\n15\n\n\nLess than cumulative frequency\n11\n20\n25\n35\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mark at the 25th position is 2 and the mark at the 26th position is 3.

For a grouped frequency distribution, the median is in the class interval which contains the \\(\\left( \\frac{N}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}\\)ordered observation, where \\(N\\) is the total number of observations. This class interval is called the median class. The median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by either of the following two methods:\nLinear interpolation method\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by linear interpolation. We assume that the observations are evenly spread through the median class. The median can then be computed by using the following formula:\n\\[Median = L + \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}N - F}{f_{m}} \\right)C \\tag{4.7}\\]\nwhere, \\(N\\) = total number of observations, \\(L\\) = lower limit of the median class, \\(F\\) = sum of all frequencies below L(cumulative frequency), \\(f_{m}\\) = frequency of the median class, \\(C\\) = class width of the median class.\nEstimation from cumulative frequency curve\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated from a cumulative frequency curve. A horizontal line is drawn from the point \\(\\frac{\\text{N}}{2}\\) on the vertical axis to meet the cumulative frequency curve.

Soldiers counted bricks in an unplastered section of the wall multiple times, and the most frequent count (what we now call the mode) was taken as the best estimate. They then multiplied this by the height of a brick to calculate the wall’s height and build ladders tall enough to scale it. Problem-solving with statistics!\nAstronomy and the mean\nAlthough the Greeks knew the concept of the arithmetic mean, it wasn’t generalized for multiple values until the 16th century. Simon Stevin’s invention of the decimal system in 1585 made it much easier to calculate. Astronomer Tycho Brahe was one of the first to use the mean, reducing errors in his estimates of celestial body locations.\nNavigation and the median\nThe concept of the median first appeared in 1599 in Edward Wright’s book on navigation, Certaine errors in navigation. Wright used it to determine the most likely value in a series of compass readings. Later, in 1669, Christiaan Huygens noticed the difference between the mean and the median while working with Graunt’s tables. It’s amazing how these early navigators and mathematicians paved the way for the stats we use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“If the statistics are boring, you’ve got the wrong numbers”:- Edward R.

    "text": "5.1 Geometric mean\nWhile simple averages like mean, median, and mode are widely used to summarize data, certain situations call for more specialized measures to capture the essence of a dataset. Special averages, including the geometric mean and harmonic mean, are tailored for specific contexts where the nature of the data or the relationships between data points require a different approach.\nThe geometric mean (GM) is a specialized measure of central tendency, particularly suited for datasets involving growth rates, ratios, or percentages, such as population growth, investment returns, or interest rates. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which calculates the average by summing values, the geometric mean finds the average by multiplying values and then taking the root (typically the nth root for n values).\nThis approach captures the compounding effects present in the data, making the geometric mean an essential tool for accurately summarizing proportional changes or rates over time. Its utility lies in providing a more representative measure for datasets where changes are multiplicative rather than additive.\nThe geometric mean of a series containing n observations is the nth root of the product of the values. If \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots, x_{n}\\) are observations then\n\\[GM = \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}} \\tag{5.1}\\]\nwhere, \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\) means the product of \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots, x_{n}\\)\n\\[= \\left( x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\]\n\\[\\log \\text{GM} = \\frac{1}{n} \\log \\left( x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n \\right)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\log x_1 + \\log x_2 + \\cdots + \\log x_n \\right)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log x_i}{n} \\tag{5.2}\\]\n\\[\\text{GM} = \\text{Antilog} \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log x_i}{n} \\right) \\tag{5.3}\\]",

    "text": "5.2 Harmonic mean\nHarmonic means are often used in averaging things like rates (e.g. the average travel speed given duration of several trips).

Pipe A can fill the cistern in 3 hours. Pipe B can fill the cistern in 5 hours. If both pipes are opened at the same time, how long will it take to fill the cistern completely?\nSolution 5.6\nTo solve the cistern problem, we first calculate the rate at which each pipe fills the cistern. Pipe A fills the cistern in 3 hours, so its rate is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the cistern per hour. Pipe B fills the cistern in 5 hours, so its rate is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) per hour. To find the combined rate, we add these rates together; \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{15}\\). This means the two pipes together fill \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\) of the cistern each hour. To find the total time, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate i.e. \\(\\text{Total time} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{8}{15}} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875\\). To convert 1.875 hours into hours and minutes, we first separate the whole number from the decimal part. 1.875 hours consists of 1 hour (the whole number) and 0.875 hours (the decimal part). Next, we convert the decimal part into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we multiply 0.875 by 60 i.e. \\(0.875 \\times 60 = 52.5 \\, \\text{minutes}\\). Rounding 52.5 minutes gives approximately 53 minutes. Thus, 1.875 hours is equivalent to 1 hour and 53 minutes.\nThe problem can be easily solved using the harmonic mean, the harmonic mean of two pipes is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\text{H.M}}=\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} +\\frac{1}{5}}\n\\]\n\\[= \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{3 + 5} = \\frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \\, \\text{hours}\\]\nthe harmonic mean of the pipes is 3.75 hours, and since both pipes are working together, the total time is half of that, which confirms the answer of 1 hour and 53 minutes.\nExample 5.7: A car travels a certain distance from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h, and returns the same distance from City B to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire trip?\nSolution 5.7\nTo find the average speed when traveling the same distance at two different speeds, we use the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean for the speed is \\(\\frac{2 \\cdot S_1 \\cdot S_2}{S_1 + S_2}\\), where \\(S_1 = 60 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) is the speed from City A to City B, \\(S_2 = 90 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) is the speed from City B to City A.\nIn this case, we are calculating the average speed over the entire round trip. The harmonic mean is used because it accounts for the fact that traveling at different speeds over the same distance results in an overall average speed that is closer to the lower of the two speeds, rather than simply averaging the two speeds.\nNow, applying the harmonic mean formula:\n\\(S_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 90}{60 + 90} = \\frac{10800}{150} = 72 \\, \\text{km/h}\\)\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is 72 km/h.\nMerits and demerits of harmonic mean\nMerits\n\nIt is rigidly defined.\nIt is defined on all observations.\nIt is amenable to further algebraic treatment.\nIt is the most suitable average when it is desired to give greater weight to smaller and less weight to the larger ones.\n\nDemerits\n\nIt is not easily understood.\nIt is difficult to compute.\nIt is only a summary figure and may not be the actual item in the series.\nIt gives greater importance to small items and is therefore, useful only when small items have to be given greater weightage.\nIt is rarely used in grouped data.",

    "section": "5.3 AM, GM or HM ?",
    "text": "5.3 AM, GM or HM ?\nThe arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), and harmonic mean (HM) are termed as Pythagorean means. The Pythagorean means refer to three specific types of means that were known to the ancient Greek mathematicians, particularly to Pythagoras and his followers. Choosing the right average depends on what you’re measuring and how the data behaves. Let’s break it down step by step in a simple way:\nArithmetic Mean (AM)\nThe arithmetic mean is the most common type of average. You use it when the values in your data add together in a straightforward way. This is suitable for quantities like:\n- Heights or weights\n- Lengths or distances\n- Marks in exams\nFor example, if you want to find the average height of students in a class, you add up all the heights and divide by the number of students. The arithmetic mean gives a meaningful average because height or weight adds linearly.\nHarmonic Mean (HM)\nThe harmonic mean is useful when you are working with rates, ratios, or situations where quantities add up as reciprocals. Some examples include:\n- Speeds (distance per unit time)\n- Capacitors in a series circuit\n- Rates like fuel efficiency or cost per unit\nFor instance, imagine you are driving the same distance at different speeds. If you want to find the average speed for the entire trip, the harmonic mean is the best choice. This is because speeds relate inversely to time when you go faster, you take less time, and vice versa.\nGeometric Mean (GM)\nThe geometric mean is the right choice when your data involves multiplication or compounding, such as:\n- Growth rates (like population growth or interest rates)\n- Percentages (like inflation rates)\n- Ratios\nFor example, if you have annual interest rates for 10 years and want to find a single rate that represents the same total growth over that period, the geometric mean gives you the answer. It works by multiplying the rates and taking the root, which accounts for the compounding effect.\nHere’s a simple example to understand how the geometric mean works. Suppose you invest Rs.100, and your investment changes over three years as follows: in the first year, it grows by 10%, represented by a growth factor of 1.10; in the second year, it grows by 20%, represented by 1.20; and in the third year, it drops by 10%, represented by 0.90. To find a single rate that would give the same overall growth over the three years, you multiply the growth factors: \\(1.10 \\times 1.20 \\times 0.90 = 1.188\\). Then, take the cube root (since there are three years): \\(\\sqrt[3]{1.188} \\approx 1.059\\). This gives a geometric mean rate of approximately 1.059, or 5.9% per year. In other words, if your Rs. 100 investment grew steadily at a rate of 5.9% each year, it would result in the same total growth over three years, leaving you with about Rs. 118.80 at the end.\nKey Takeaways\n1. Use Arithmetic Mean when values combine directly, like adding lengths or weights.\n2. Use Harmonic Mean for rates or quantities that work reciprocally, like speed or resistance.\n3. Use Geometric Mean for data involving multiplication or compounding, like growth rates or percentages.\nBy understanding the relationship between the data and the type of average, you can choose the most meaningful measure for your analysis.",

    "text": "6.1 Characteristics of a good measure of dispersion\nIn the previous chapters, we have seen how a set of data can be summarized by a single representative value that describes the central tendency of the data. Consider the two sets of data, A and B, in Table 6.1.\nYou can see mean, median and mode for both the sets A & B in Table 6.1 is 3.\nThe plot of values of A and B in Table 6.1 can be seen in Figure 6.1. The figure is known as dot plot.\nIt can be seen in Figure 6.1 that, while values of data set A are grouped close to their mean, while the values of data set B are more spread out. We say that values of data set B are more dispersed (or scattered) than those of data set A. This example shows that the measures of central tendency are not enough in describing a set of data. In addition to using these measures, we need numerical measures of dispersion (or variation) of a set of data.\nAn ideal measure of dispersion is expected to possess the following properties\nThe most important measures of dispersion are range, quartile deviation, variance, inter-quartile range, mean absolute deviation and standard deviation.",

    "text": "6.3 The inter-quartile range (IQR)\nThe range is a simple and quick measure to calculate. However, because it relies solely on the maximum and minimum values in a data set, it does not provide information about how the data is distributed between these two values. As a result, the range may not be an effective measure of dispersion, especially if one or both of these values are significantly different from the rest of the data. To address this limitation, the interquartile range is often used. The interquartile range is a more robust measure of dispersion, defined as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles of the data. IQR is also known as midspread. Thus,\n\\[IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 \\tag{6.2}\\]\nThe inter-quartile range of a set of data is therefore not affected by values of the data outside Q1 and Q3 making it a more reliable measure of spread for skewed or non-normal distributions.\nExample 6.3: Consider the two sets of data A & B below, find IQR\n\n\n\nTable 6.4: Model dataset for IQR calculation\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n4\n5\n6\n8\n9\n10\n12\n15\n\n\nB\n3\n8\n8\n9\n9\n9\n10\n10\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor data set A, Q1 = 4.5, Q3 = 11; so Inter-Quartile Range = 11 – 4.5 = 6.5\nFor data set B, Q1 = 8, Q3 = 10; so Inter-Quartile Range = 10 – 8 = 2\nSince the interquartile range (IQR) of data set A is greater than that of data set B, these results indicate that data set A is more dispersed than data set B.

Variance is expressed in squared units, making it harder to interpret. For example, if the data represents lengths in meters, the variance is in square meters (m²), which complicates understanding variability. In contrast, standard deviation is the square root of variance, preserving the original unit (e.g., meters), making it more intuitive. Thus, standard deviation is preferred for its clarity and ease of interpretation, especially when analyzing how data points deviate from the mean.\n\n\nIf the standard deviation of data set A is greater than that of data set B, it indicates that data set A is more dispersed than data set B. A higher standard deviation means that the values in data set A are more spread out from the mean compared to the values in data set B. It’s important to note that the standard deviation of any data set is always a non-negative number, as it represents the square root of the variance, which is always non-negative. Variance and standard deviation can never be negative values.\nExample 6.5: Consider the Table 6.1 discussed earlier, find the standard deviation?\nSolution 6.5\n\n\n\nTable 6.6: Calculation of standard deviation of set A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet A\n\\[x_{i}\\]\n\\[x_{i} - \\overline{x}\\]\n\\[\n\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n1\n-2\n4\n\n\n\n2\n-1\n1\n\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n\n\n\n5\n2\n4\n\n\nSum\n18\n0\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (\\(\\overline{x}\\)) =\\(\\ \\frac{18}{6} = 3\\)\n\\[{Sample\\ variance,\\ s}_{A}^{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}}{n - 1} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\\]\n\\[\\text{Sample standard deviation,}\\ s_{A} = \\ \\sqrt{s_{A}^{2}} = \\ \\sqrt{2} = 1.414\\]\n\n\n\nTable 6.7: Calculation of standard deviation of set B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet B\n\\[x_{i}\\]\n\\[x_{i} - \\overline{x}\\]\n\\[\n\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n-1\n-4\n16\n\n\n\n0\n-3\n9\n\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n\n\n5\n2\n4\n\n\n\n8\n5\n25\n\n\nSum\n18\n0\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (\\(\\overline{x}\\)) =\\(\\ \\frac{18}{6} = 3\\)\n\\[{Sample\\ variance,\\ s}_{B}^{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}}{n - 1} = \\frac{54}{5} = 10.8\\]\n\\[Sample\\ standard\\ deviation,\\ s_{B} = \\ \\sqrt{s_{B}^{2}} = \\ \\sqrt{10.8} = 3.29\\]\nIt can be seen that \\(s_{B} &gt; s_{A}\\), confirming that data set B is more dispersed than data set A as shown in Figure 6.1.\nAn alternative formula for computing the variance\nThe computation of s² requires calculations of \\(\\overline{x}\\), n subtractions and n squaring and adding operations.

    "text": "6.6 Coefficient of variation\nThe standard deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion. It is expressed in terms of units in which the original figures are collected and stated. The standard deviation of heights of plants cannot be compared with the standard deviation of weights of the grains, as both are expressed in different units, i.e. heights in centimetre and weights in kilograms.\nTherefore, the standard deviation must be converted into a relative measure of dispersion for the purpose of comparison. The relative measure is known as the coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and expressed in percentage.\n\\[\\text{Coefficient of variation} \\, (C.V) = \\frac{\\text{standard deviation}}{\\text{mean}} \\times 100 \\tag{6.9}\\]\nA higher C.V. indicates greater variability in the dataset, meaning the data values are more dispersed relative to the mean. In contrast, a lower C.V. signifies lower variability, indicating that the data values are more closely clustered around the mean. This measure is particularly useful when comparing datasets with different units or scales.\nExample 6.9: Consider the measurement on yield and plant height of a paddy variety. The mean and standard deviation for yield are 50 kg and 10 kg respectively. The mean and standard deviation for plant height are 55 cm and 5 cm respectively. Compare the variability.\nSolution 6.9\nHere, the measurements for yield and plant height are in different units. Hence the variability can be compared only by using coefficient of variation.\nFor yield, CV = \\(\\ \\frac{10}{50} \\times 100 =\\) 20%\nFor plant height, CV = \\(\\frac{5}{55} \\times 100 =\\) 9.1%\nThe yield is subject to more variation than the plant height.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Insights\n\n\n\nExploring variability\nThe term “standard deviation” was first introduced in writing by Karl Pearson in 1894 in his paper “Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution.” Prior to this, the concept was referred to by other names, including “mean error,” “mean square error,” and “error of mean square,” reflecting its origins in the study of measurement errors and variability.(Pearson 1894)\nThe concept of variance was formalized in 1918 by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher in his seminal paper “The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance.” While earlier mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss made significant contributions to the development of probability and error theory, which influenced the understanding of variability, the term “variance” as we know it today was introduced by Fisher.(Fisher 1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“The object of our being statistical is to learn how to improve the whole health of humanity” – Florence nightingale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFisher, Ronald A. 1918. “The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance.” Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 52 (2): 399–433. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0080456800012163.\n\n\nPearson, Karl. 1894. “Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution.” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

While a histogram provides a visual summary of the shape, we often need numerical measures for precise analysis. These measures include:\nIn this chapter, we will have a detailed discussion on these two important measures of shape, understanding how they are calculated and interpreted. By the end, you’ll be able to evaluate whether a distribution is symmetric, positively or negatively skewed, and whether it has light or heavy tails.\nSkewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. Then you may ask, what will a symmetric distribution looks like.

We shall discuss four measures.\n\n7.2.1 Karl Pearson’s coefficient of skewness (\\(S_{k}\\))\nYou have noticed that the mean, median and mode are not equal in a skewed distribution. The Karl Pearson’s measure of skewness is based upon the divergence of mean from mode in a skewed distribution.\n\\[S_{k} = \\frac{mean - mode}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\tag{7.1}\\]\nThe sign of \\(S_{k}\\) gives the direction of skewness and its magnitude gives the extent of skewness. If \\(S_{k}\\) &gt; 0, the distribution is positively skewed, and if \\(S_{k}\\) &lt; 0 it is negatively skewed.\nIn Equation 7.1 since mode is used, there is a problem that if mode is not defined for a distribution we cannot find \\(S_{k}\\). But empirical relation between mean, median and mode states that, for a moderately symmetrical distribution \\(\\ mean - mode \\approx 3(mean - median)\\).

However, in order to use it you must know the mean, mode (or median) and standard deviation for your data. Sometimes you might not have that information; instead you might have information about quartiles. If that’s the case, you can use Bowley’s measure of skewness as an alternative to find out more about the asymmetry of your distribution. It’s very useful if you have extreme data values (outliers) or if you have an open-ended distribution.\n\\[{Bowley’s\\ measure\\ of\\ Skewness,\\ S}_{Q} = \\frac{\\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \\right) - \\left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \\right)}{\\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \\right) + \\left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \\right)} \\tag{7.3}\\]\nwhere, \\(Q_{1}\\) = 1st quartile; \\(Q_{2}\\) = median; \\(Q_{3}\\) = 3rd quartile\nEquation can be further modified into\n\\[S_{Q} = \\frac{Q_{3} - 2Q_{2} + Q_{1}}{Q_{3} - Q_{1}} \\tag{7.4}\\]\n\n\\(S_{Q}\\) = 0 means that the curve is symmetrical.\n\\(S_{Q}\\) &gt; 0 means the curve is positively skewed.\n\\(S_{Q}\\)&lt; 0 means the curve is negatively skewed.\n\nLets find Bowley’s measure of skewness for Table 7.1 in Example 7.1 from the cumulative frequency in Table 7.3, quartiles can be calculated. Calculation of \\({Q}_{1}\\), \\(Q_{2}\\), \\(Q_{3}\\) is given in Section 5.6.\n\\[{Q}_{1} = 60\\]\n\\[Q_{2} = 61\\]\n\\[Q_{3} = 63\\]\n\\[S_{Q} = \\frac{63 - (2 \\times 61) + 60}{63 - 60} = \\ \\frac{1}{3} = 0.33\\]\nSince \\(S_{Q}\\) &gt; 0 means the curve is positively skewed.\n\n\n7.2.3 Kelly’s measure of skewness (Sp)\nBowley’s measure of skewness is based on the middle 50% of the observations; it leaves 25% of the observations on each extreme of the distribution. As an improvement over Bowley’s measure, Kelly has suggested a measure based on Percentiles, including P10 and P90 so that only 10% of the observations on each extreme are ignored.\n\\[{Kelly's\\ Measure\\ of\\ Skewness,\\ S}_{p} = \\frac{\\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \\right) - \\left( P_{50} - P_{10} \\right)}{\\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \\right) + \\left( P_{50} - P_{10} \\right)} \\tag{7.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry yourself\nTry to find Kelly’s measure of skewness for Table 7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Measure based on moments\nBefore going into measuring skewness using moments, one should know what a moment is:\nMoments\nThe rth moment about mean of a distribution, denoted by \\(\\mu_r\\) is given by\n\\[\\mu_{r} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{r}}}{N} \\tag{7.6}\\]\nwhere, \\(f_{i}\\) is the frequency of ith observation or class mark\\(\\ x_{i}\\), \\(N = \\sum_{}^{}f_{i}\\), number of observations\nMoment about mean is also called as central moment.\nIf r = 0, \\(\\mu_{0} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{0}}}{N}\\) = 1\nIf r = 1, \\(\\mu_{1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{1}}}{N}\\) = 0 (sum of deviation about mean is zero)\nIf r = 2, \\(\\mu_{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}}}{N}\\) = \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), Population variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt should be remembered that first moment about mean is 0 and second moment about mean is variance.\n\n\nFor Table 7.1 in Example 7.1 given above, calculate third central moment, \\(\\mu_{3}\\)\n\n\n\nTable 7.4: Third central moment calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight (\\(x_{i}\\))\n\n\nfrequency (\\(f_{i}\\))\n\n\n\\(\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x} \\right)^{3}\\)\n\n\n\\({f_{i}\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x}\\right)}^{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n10\n\n\n-39.304\n\n\n-393.040\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n18\n\n\n-13.824\n\n\n-248.832\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n30\n\n\n-2.744\n\n\n-82.320\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n42\n\n\n-0.064\n\n\n-2.688\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n35\n\n\n0.216\n\n\n7.560\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n28\n\n\n4.096\n\n\n114.688\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\n16\n\n\n17.576\n\n\n281.216\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n8\n\n\n46.656\n\n\n373.248\n\n\n\n\nSum\n\n\n187\n\n\n12.608\n\n\n49.832\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean = 61.40\n\\[\\mu_{3} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{3}}}{N} = \\ \\frac{49.832}{187} = 0.266\\]\nIn short values of following moments about mean are\n\n\n\nTable 7.5: Moments about mean\n\n\n\n\n\nMoments about mean\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mu_{0}\\]\n1\n\n\n\\[\\mu_{1}\\]\n0\n\n\n\\[\\mu_{2}\\]\n\\(\\sigma^{2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta one and gamma one\nThe moment measure of skewness is based on the property that, for a symmetrical distribution, all odd ordered central moments are equal to zero.

The greater the value of \\(\\beta_{1}\\) the more skewed the distribution.

    "text": "7.3 Kurtosis\nKurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s frequency curve, focusing on its relative peakedness. While skewness measures the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in a distribution, kurtosis evaluates how sharp or flat the peak of the curve is. There are three categories of frequency curves depending upon the shape of their peak as shown in Figure 7.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: Three categories of frequency curves\n\n\n\nKurtosis refers to degree of flatness or peakedness of the curve. It is measured relative to the peakedness of normal curve. The normal curve is considered as mesokurtic. If a curve is more peaked than normal curve, it is called leptokurtic. If a curve is more flat-topped than normal curve, it is called platykurtic. The condition of peakedness (leptokurtic) or flatness (platykurtic) is called kurtosis of excess.\n\n7.3.1 Measure of kurtosis\nKurtosis is measured using \\(\\beta_{2}\\) ‘beta two’ and \\(\\gamma_{2}\\) ‘gamma two’ given by Karl Pearson\n\\[\\beta_{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{4}}{\\mu_{2}^{2}} \\tag{7.9}\\]\nwhere, \\(\\mu_{4}\\) is the 4th central moment, \\(\\mu_{2}\\) is the 2nd central moment\n\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) = 3 means that the curve is mesokurtic.\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) &gt; 3 means the curve is leptokurtic.\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\)&lt; 3 means the curve is platykurtic.\n\n\\[\\gamma_{2} = \\beta_{2} - 3 \\tag{7.10}\\]\n\n\\(\\gamma_{2}\\) = 0 means that the curve is mesokurtic.\n\\(\\gamma_{2}\\) &gt; 0 means the curve is leptokurtic.\n\\(\\gamma_{2}\\)&lt; 0 means the curve is platykurtic.\n\nFor Table 7.1 in Example 7.1, kurtosis can be examined as follows\n\n\n\nTable 7.6: Measures of kurtosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight (\\(x_{i}\\))\n\n\nfrequency (\\(f_{i}\\))\n\n\n\\(\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x} \\right)^{4}\\)\n\n\n\\({f_{i}\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x}\\right)}^{4}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n10\n\n\n133.634\n\n\n1336.336\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n18\n\n\n33.178\n\n\n597.197\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n30\n\n\n3.842\n\n\n115.248\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n42\n\n\n0.026\n\n\n1.075\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n35\n\n\n0.130\n\n\n4.536\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n28\n\n\n6.554\n\n\n183.501\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\n16\n\n\n45.698\n\n\n731.162\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n8\n\n\n167.962\n\n\n1343.693\n\n\n\n\nSum\n\n\n187\n\n\n391.021\n\n\n4312.747\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean, \\(\\overline{x}\\) = 61.40\n\\(\\mu_{2}\\) = 3.123 (calculation shown in previous example)\n\\(\\mu_{4} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{4}}}{N} = \\frac{4312.747}{187} = 23.062\\)\n\\(\\beta_{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{4}}{\\mu_{2}^{2}} = \\frac{23.062}{\\left( 3.123 \\right)^{2}} = 2.364\\)\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) is 2.364, which is close to 3, distribution can be considered slightly platykurtic close to symmetric.\nYou can verify the frequency curve of Example 7.1 Figure 7.9, it can be seen that it is slightly right tailed (positively skewed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Frequency curve of Example 7.1\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Insights\n\n\n\n“Crabs and kurtosis”\nThe story of kurtosis and skewness begins with a fascinating scientific journey involving crabs! In the late 1800s, Karl Pearson, a pioneering statistician, worked with biologist Walter Weldon to study variations in the size of crustaceans, like crabs. They noticed that the data didn’t follow the usual normal pattern, so Pearson developed new tools to better understand the shapes of these unusual data distributions.\nHe created the concept of skewness to measure whether the data was symmetrical or had long tails on one side. Then, he developed kurtosis, a measure of how “peaked” or “flat” the data distribution was compared to the normal curve. These ideas helped statisticians better analyze data that didn’t fit the typical patterns, paving the way for modern statistical tools we still use today!

    "text": "8.1 Linear and monotonic relationship\nIn the previous chapters, we examined measures of central tendency, which summarize the location of data, and measures of dispersion, which describe the spread around that location. Together, these tools provided us with a foundation for understanding and summarizing a single dataset. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are interested in understanding the relationships between variables rather than focusing on one variable in isolation.\nMeasures of association allow us to explore and quantify the connections between two or more variables. For example, does fertilizer use influence crop yield? Is there a relationship between farm size and agricultural income? Do education levels impact the adoption of new farming technologies? By studying association, we can answer such questions and uncover meaningful patterns in data.\nIn this chapter, we will introduce key measures of association, such as covariance, correlation coefficients, and other related metrics. We will discuss how these measures are calculated, interpreted, and applied to analyze relationships between variables. By the end of this chapter, you will be equipped to assess both the strength and direction of relationships, providing deeper insights into agricultural and social science research.\nLinear relationship\nA linear relationship (or linear association) is a statistical term used to describe a straight-line relationship between variables. Linear relationships can be expressed either in a graphical format where the variable plotted on X-Y plane gives a straight line or relation between two variables (consider x and y) can be expressed with an equation of a straight line (y = a + bx) (will be more clear when we discuss regression in Chapter 9).\nMonotonic relation\nA monotonic relationship between two variables means that as one variable increases or decreases, the other tends to move in the same direction, but not necessarily at a constant rate. In contrast, a linear relationship implies that the variables move in the same direction at a constant rate. While all linear relationships are monotonic, not all monotonic relationships are linear.

It quantifies the degree and strength of the linear association between two variables, expressed as a single numerical value.\nThis measure allows us to summarize the extent to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. When two or more quantities vary in a related manner, such that movements in one variable are consistently accompanied by movements in the other, the variables are said to be correlated. Based on the nature of relationship, correlation can be classified into three categories positive correlation, negative correlation and no correlation.\nPositive correlation\nPositive correlation refers to a relationship between two variables in which both move in the same direction. A positive correlation exists when an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other, or when a decrease in one variable corresponds with a decrease in the other.\nExamples of positive correlation:\n\nFertilizer use and crop yield: The more fertilizer (x) a farmer applies to a field, the higher the crop yield (y). Here, as x increases, y also increases.\nRainfall and crop growth: Increased rainfall (x) often leads to better crop growth (y).\nFarm size and agricultural output: Larger farm sizes (x) are associated with greater total agricultural output (y).\nLabor hours and harvest quantity: The more hours spent harvesting (x), the higher the quantity of crops harvested (y).\n\nNegative correlation\nNegative correlation refers to a relationship between two variables in which one variable increases as the other decreases, and vice versa.\nExamples of negative correlation:\n\nWeed density and crop yield: As the density of weeds in a field (x) increases, the crop yield (y) decreases. Here, as x increases, y decreases.\nSoil salinity and plant growth: Higher soil salinity levels (x) result in reduced plant growth (y).\nAge of livestock and milk production: As a cow’s age (x) increases, the amount of milk it produces (y) decreases. Here, as x increases, y decreases.\nPesticide application and pest population: As the amount of pesticide applied (x) increases, the pest population (y) decreases. Here, x increases while y decreases.\n\nNo correlation refers to a statistical relationship where two variables exhibit no apparent association with each other.

    "section": "8.5 Measuring correlation",
    "text": "8.5 Measuring correlation\nWhile a scatter diagram provides a visual representation to examine whether there is an association between two variables, it does not give a precise measure of the strength or direction of the relationship. To understand the degree and nature of the correlation more quantitatively, we use numerical measures. In this section, we discuss various methods to quantify correlation, enabling a more comprehensive and objective analysis of the relationship between variables.\n\n8.5.1 Karl Pearson’s coefficient of correlation\nIt is the most important and widely used measure of correlation. A measure of the intensity or degree of linear relationship between two variables is developed by Karl Pearson, a British Biometrician - known as the Pearson’s correlation coefficient denoted by ‘r’ which is expressed as the ratio of the covariance to the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.\nCovariance\nCovariance is a measure of the joint linear variability of the two variables. Covariance of two variables x and y is denoted as cov(x, y). Covariance measure is used to find correlation coefficient. Consider two variables x and y with n observations each, then covariance is given by Equation 8.1\n\\[cov(x,y)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)} \\tag{8.1}\\]\nWhen covariance = 0 there is no joint variability or there is no linear relationship. The unit of covariance is the product of the units of the two variables.\nPearson’s correlation coefficient\nAssumptions of Pearson’s correlation coefficient\nTo ensure the validity of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, the following assumptions must be met:\n\nLinearity: The relationship between the two variables must be linear. Pearson’s correlation only measures the strength of linear associations, so it may not accurately describe relationships that are non-linear.\nContinuous data: Both variables should be measured on continuous scales (interval or ratio).\nNormality: Both variables should be approximately normally distributed, especially for small sample sizes. This assumption is less critical for large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem.\nHomoscedasticity: The variability in one variable should remain constant across the range of the other variable. In other words, the scatter of points around the regression line should be uniform.\nIndependence: Observations in the data should be independent of each other.\nNo significant outliers: Outliers can have a disproportionate effect on Pearson’s correlation, potentially distorting the results. An outlier is an observation in a dataset that is significantly different from other observations. It deviates markedly from the overall pattern of the data and may occur due to variability in the data, measurement errors, or rare events.\n\nViolations of these assumptions may lead to incorrect or misleading interpretations of the correlation coefficient. In such cases, alternative methods like Spearman’s correlation discussed in Section 8.5.2 may be more appropriate.\nThe Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the two variables (x and y) is calculated using Equation 8.2. Equation 8.2 can be also written as in Equation 8.3\n\\[r=\\frac{cov(x,y)}{sd(x)sd(y)} \\tag{8.2}\\]\nwhere sd is the standard deviation.\n\\[r = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)^{2}}} \\tag{8.3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProduct-moment correlation\nKarl Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) is also called the product-moment correlation coefficient because it is calculated using the product of the deviations of the two variables from their respective means. In other words, the Equation 8.3 involves multiplying the deviations of each data point from the mean of its variable and then averaging those products. The term product-moment refers to the multiplication (product) of the deviations (moments) of the variables from their means.\n\n\nA simplified formula for by hand computation of correlation coefficient can be derived by modifying Equation 8.3\n\\[r = \\frac{n\\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_{i}y_{i}} \\right) - \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_{i}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i}}}{\\sqrt{\\left\\lbrack n\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_{i}^{2} - \\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} \\right)^{2}} \\right\\rbrack\\left\\lbrack n\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}^{2} - \\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} \\right)^{2}} \\right\\rbrack}} \\tag{8.4}\\]\nProperties of the correlation coefficient (r)\n\nIt is a pure number independent of both origin and scale of the units of the observations.\nIt always lies between −1 and +1 (absolute value cannot exceed unity).i.e. −1 ≤ r ≤ +1\nr = +1, indicates perfect positive correlation. r = −1, indicates perfect negative correlation. r = 0, indicates no correlation.\nWhen the correlation is zero then there is no linear relationship between the variables.\nKarl Pearson’s correlation coefficient is also called as product-moment correlation coefficient.\nTwo independent variables are always uncorrelated, meaning that there is no relationship between them. However, the reverse is not always true. Just because two variables are uncorrelated doesn’t mean they are independent. Uncorrelated variables may still have a relationship, but the relationship might be non-linear, which correlation cannot capture. Independence implies no relationship in any form (linear or non-linear), but uncorrelated means there’s no linear relationship between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpurious correlation\nWhen we calculate the correlation between two variables, we often get a numerical value that quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between them. However, if there is no actual meaningful relationship between these variables, the correlation value obtained may be misleading. For example, even if there’s no practical or causal link, we might find a correlation between variables like “fertilizer price” and “Kohli’s batting average.” Despite the absence of any real-world connection between these two variables, we can still compute a correlation value. This type of correlation is known as a spurious correlation, which means it exists purely due to random chance or statistical artifacts rather than any practical or causal relationship.\n\n\nExample 8.3: Consider the Table 8.2 in Example 8.2; find correlation coefficient (r)\n\n\n\nTable 8.3: Calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient for Table 8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSl.

Spearman’s correlation is denoted by a Greek letter \\(\\rho\\) pronounced as “rho”. The range of Spearman’s rank correlation also lies between −1 and +1 always, i.e. −1 ≤ ρ ≤+1\nUnlike Pearson’s correlation, which measures linear relationships, Spearman’s correlation is based on the ranked values of the variables rather than their raw data. This makes it particularly useful in situations where:\n\nThe relationship between variables is non-linear but monotonic.\nThe data contains outliers or is not normally distributed, as ranking reduces the influence of extreme values.\nVariables are measured on an ordinal, interval, or ratio scale.\n\nSpearman’s correlation is a more robust alternative to Pearson’s when the assumptions of Pearson’s correlation coefficient are violated.\nThere are two cases in calculating \\(\\rho\\) :\n\nNo tied rank case\nTied rank case\n\nNo tied rank case\nWhen two or more distinct observations have the same value, thus being given the same rank, they are said to be tied. The formula for the Spearman rank correlation coefficient when there are no tied ranks is:\n\\[\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}d_{i}^{2}}{n\\left( n^{2} - 1 \\right)} \\tag{8.5}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{i}\\) is the difference between ranks of ith pair of observation\nExample 8.4: Calculation of Spearman’s rank correlation when there is no tied rank is explained step by step by using the simple example below\nThe scores for nine students in physics and mathematics are as follows:\nPhysics: 35, 23, 47, 17, 10, 43, 9, 6, 28\nMathematics: 30, 33, 45, 23, 8, 49, 12, 4, 31\nCompute the student’s ranks in the two subjects and compute the Spearman rank correlation.\n\n\n\nTable 8.4: Non tied rank case example dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics\nMathematics\n\n\n\n\n35\n30\n\n\n23\n33\n\n\n47\n45\n\n\n17\n23\n\n\n10\n8\n\n\n43\n49\n\n\n9\n12\n\n\n6\n4\n\n\n28\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Find the ranks for each individual subject.

The d is the difference between ranks.\nd = Rankx – Ranky\nFor example, the first student’s physics rank is 3 and math rank is 5, so the difference is -2. In the next column, square your d values.\n\n\n\nTable 8.6: Non tied rank case calculation table2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics (x)\nRankx\nMathematics (y)\nRanky\nd\nd2\n\n\n\n\n35\n3\n30\n5\n-2\n4\n\n\n23\n5\n33\n3\n2\n4\n\n\n47\n1\n45\n2\n-1\n1\n\n\n17\n6\n23\n6\n0\n0\n\n\n10\n7\n8\n8\n-1\n1\n\n\n43\n2\n49\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n9\n8\n12\n7\n1\n1\n\n\n6\n9\n4\n9\n0\n0\n\n\n28\n4\n31\n4\n0\n0\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Sum (add up) all of your d2 values. \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}d_{i}^{2} =\\) 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 12.\nStep 5: Insert the values into Equation 8.5\n\\[\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 12}{9\\left( 81 - 1 \\right)} = 0.90\\]\nThe Spearman’s rank correlation for this set of data is 0.90. This indicates there is a high correlation between the marks of physics and mathematics in the sample.\nTied rank case\nWhen two or more data points have the same value, same ranks were given to these data points and a tied rank case occurs. When there are tied ranks, the formula for calculating \\(\\rho\\) is given below \\[\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6\\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}d_{i}^{2} + T_{x} + T_{y} \\right)}{n\\left( n^{2} - 1 \\right)} \\tag{8.6}\\]\nIf there are m individuals tied (having same rank), and s such sets of ranks are there in X- series then, \\[T_{x} = \\ \\frac{1}{12}\\sum_{i = 1}^{s}{m_{i}\\left( m_{i}^{2} - 1 \\right)} \\tag{8.7}\\]\nIf there are w individuals tied (having same rank), and s’ such sets of ranks are there in Y- series then, \\[T_{y} = \\ \\frac{1}{12}\\sum_{i = 1}^{s'}{w_{i}\\left( w_{i}^{2} - 1 \\right)} \\tag{8.8}\\]\nCalculation of Spearman’s rank correlation when there is tied rank is explained step by step by using the example below\nExample 8.5: The scores for nine students in physics and mathematics are as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 8.7: Tied rank case example dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics (x)\nMathematics (y)\n\n\n\n\n35\n30\n\n\n23\n33\n\n\n47\n45\n\n\n23\n23\n\n\n10\n8\n\n\n43\n49\n\n\n9\n12\n\n\n6\n33\n\n\n28\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Consider the marks in Physics, ranked as usual without considering the repeated value.

Applying these values in Equation 8.8 \\(T_{y} = \\ \\frac{1}{12}\\left( 3 \\times (3^{2} - 1 \\right)\\) = 2\nStep 2: Calculate d and then use the Equation 8.6\n\n\n\nTable 8.12: Tied rank case calculation table-5\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics (x)\nRank\nMathematics (y)\nRank\nd\nd2\n\n\n\n\n35\n3\n30\n6\n-3\n9\n\n\n23\n5.5\n33\n4\n1.5\n2.25\n\n\n47\n1\n45\n2\n-1\n1\n\n\n23\n5.5\n23\n7\n-1.5\n2.25\n\n\n10\n7\n8\n9\n-2\n4\n\n\n43\n2\n49\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n9\n8\n12\n8\n0\n0\n\n\n6\n9\n33\n4\n5\n25\n\n\n28\n4\n33\n4\n0\n0\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n0\n44.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing Equation 8.6, \\(\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times \\left( 44.5 + 0.5 + 2 \\right)}{9\\left( 9^{2} - 1 \\right)} = \\ 1 - \\frac{282}{720}\\) = 0.61\nA Spearman rank correlation of 0.61 indicates a moderately strong positive monotonic relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation is a non-parametric method, meaning it does not rely on assumptions about the data’s distribution and is suitable for ordinal data or non-linear relationships. In contrast, Karl Pearson’s correlation is a parametric method that assumes the data follows a normal distribution and is used for continuous variables with a linear relationship. Parametric methods are more sensitive to outliers and deviations from assumptions, while non-parametric methods are more robust and versatile for different types of data.\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Kendall’s Rank Correlation Coefficient\nKendall’s rank correlation coefficient, also known as Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) or the coefficient of concordance, is a measure of association that evaluates the degree of agreement between ranked variables. It ranges from 0 to 1 i.e. \\(0\\leq \\tau \\leq1\\), where \\(\\tau = 0\\): indicates no agreement. \\(\\tau = 1\\): indicates perfect agreement.\nWhen there are multiple sets of rankings (k sets), Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (\\(\\tau\\)) can be used to assess the association among them. This measure is particularly useful in evaluating the reliability or consistency of scores assigned by multiple judges or raters. By quantifying the agreement across different rankings, it provides a robust way to analyze consensus in subjective evaluations or repeated assessments.\nTo calculate Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (\\(\\tau\\)), the data is organized into a table where each row represents the ranks assigned by a different judge to the same set of n objects. Each column in the table corresponds to the ranks given by a judge to n objects.\nFor k judges, there will be k sets of rankings for each object. The table should look like this:\n\n\n\nTable 8.13: Model table for the calculation of Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\nJudge 1\nJudge 2\n…\nJudge k\n\n\n\n\n1\nR11\nR12\n…\nR1k\n\n\n2\nR21\nR22\n…\nR2k\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nn\nRn1\nRn2\n…\nRnk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 8.13 each row represents the ranks assigned to an object by all (k) judges. Each column represents the ranks for each object assigned by a particular judge. \\(R_{ij}\\) is the rank assigned to the ith object by the jth object, where i = 1, 2, …, n and j = 1, 2, …, k.\nKendall’s coefficient of concordance (\\(\\tau\\)) is calculated using Equation 8.9.\n\\[\\tau = \\frac{12\\left\\lbrack \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{R_{i}^{2} - \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}R_{i} \\right)^{2}}{n}} \\right\\rbrack}{k^{2}n\\left( n^{2} - 1 \\right)} \\tag{8.9}\\]\nwhere \\(R_{i} =\\sum_{j = 1}^{k}{R_{ij}}\\), i.e. the sum of ranks obtained by each object. Calculation of Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) is explained in Example 8.6\nExample 8.6: In a crop production competition, 10 entries of farmers were ranked by agricultural scientists (judges). Find the degree of agreement among the scientist for the competition result given below.\n\n\n\nTable 8.14: Rankings of 10 farmers by agricultural scientists\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmers\nScientist 1\nScientist 2\nScientist 3\nScientist 4\n\n\n1\n4\n5\n3\n7\n\n\n2\n10\n9\n8\n6\n\n\n3\n8\n6\n10\n9\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n5\n1\n3\n4\n2\n\n\n6\n2\n1\n1\n4\n\n\n7\n5\n7\n6\n5\n\n\n8\n6\n2\n5\n3\n\n\n9\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n10\n9\n10\n7\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 8.6\n\n\n\nTable 8.15: Calculation of Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmers\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\n\\(R _{i}\\) (sum of ranks)\n\\(R _ {i} ^ {2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n5\n3\n7\n19\n361\n\n\n2\n10\n9\n8\n6\n33\n1089\n\n\n3\n8\n6\n10\n9\n33\n1089\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n2\n1\n10\n100\n\n\n5\n1\n3\n4\n2\n10\n100\n\n\n6\n2\n1\n1\n4\n8\n64\n\n\n7\n5\n7\n6\n5\n23\n529\n\n\n8\n6\n2\n5\n3\n16\n256\n\n\n9\n7\n8\n9\n10\n34\n1156\n\n\n10\n9\n10\n7\n8\n34\n1156\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n220\n5900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhere k = number of judges = 4; n = number of farmers = 10; \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{10}R_{i}^{2}\\) = (220)2 = 48400; \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{10}R_{i}^{2}\\) = 5900.

This level of concordance implies that the rankings are strongly aligned, indicating a high level of agreement across the judges’ evaluations.",

    "text": "8.6 Correlation matrix\nA correlation matrix is a table that displays the correlation coefficients between multiple variables. It is particularly useful for presenting the correlation values of several variables at the same time. The matrix can be computed using either Pearson’s correlation or Spearman’s correlation. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation coefficient between the two variables at the intersecting row and column. These values range from -1 to 1. The diagonal elements are always equal to 1, as a variable is perfectly correlated with itself. Additionally, the matrix is symmetrical across the diagonal, since the correlation between x and y is the same as the correlation between y and x.\nExample 8.7: Data below gives the measurement on several plant growth characters.

    "section": "8.7 Correlogram",
    "text": "8.7 Correlogram\nA correlogram is a graphical representation of a correlation matrix. It is used to visualize the pairwise correlation coefficients between multiple variables in a dataset. The correlogram uses color and size to represent the strength and direction of the correlation, helping to quickly identify relationships among variables. The most common way to display a correlogram is through a matrix of circles or squares, where each shape represents the correlation between two variables. Correlogram can be drawn using packages like corrplot (Wei and Simko 2021) in R software (Team 2024). Different colours and styles are available to make the presentation attractive. Correlation matrix and correlogram can also be generated using our online platform available at www.kaugrapes.com (Pratheesh P. Gopinath 2020).\n\n\n\nCorrelogram of growth characters in Example 8.7",

    "text": "9.1 Simple linear regression\nRegression analysis is one of the most important tools in statistics, used to understand and quantify the relationships between variables. In essence, regression helps us answer questions such as, “How does a change in one factor (like fertilizer usage) affect another factor (like crop yield)?” It provides a mathematical framework to explore these relationships based on observed data.\nRegression analysis involves two types of variables:\nWhy use regression analysis?\nRegression analysis is particularly useful because it allows you to:\nTypes of regression\nThere are different types of regression techniques, depending on the nature of the data and the relationship between variables:\nPractical applications\nRegression analysis has a wide range of applications across fields:\nBy the end of this chapter, you will learn how to perform regression analysis, interpret its results, and understand its assumptions and limitations. This will enable you to use regression as a powerful tool for making informed decisions and predictions.\nRegression can be simply defined as a technique of fitting best line or line of best fit to estimate value of one variable on the basis of another variable. Now what is a best line? or line of best fit?. To understand this concept better, consider the data presented in Table 8.2, which shows the average daily soil moisture content and the corresponding monetary yield from crops in Example 8.2 of Section 8.2. This example helps visualize how the relationship between two variables—soil moisture content (independent variable) and crop yield (dependent variable).\nWe can use regression analysis to answer the following questions. What will be the crop yield in rupees when soil moisture content is maintained at 20%?. What is the functional form of relationship between soil moisture content and monetary crop yield?.\nRefer to the scatter diagram of Table 8.2 in Figure 8.3. To represent the relationship between soil moisture content and monetary crop yield, we might attempt to draw a line, as illustrated in Figure 9.1. However, as shown in Figure 9.1, it’s possible to draw numerous lines through the data points. This raises the question: which line is the best fit?\nThe best fit line is defined as the one that minimizes the distances between the observed data points and the line itself. These distances, which represent how far each data point is from the line, are minimized collectively using a specific criterion. The regression technique provides a systematic approach to determine and draw this best fit line. Before diving further into regression, it is essential to understand the concepts of error and residuals, which play a critical role in determining the best fit line. The entire topic of regression is on how to draw a best fit line?.",

Since the true regression line is based on the entire population and is usually unknown, the error is a theoretical concept that cannot be directly calculated.\nA residual is the difference between an observed value and the value predicted by a regression line based on sample data. Specifically, for a given data point, the residual is calculated as the observed value minus the predicted value from the regression line. Residuals are measurable because they are derived from the observed data and the regression line that is obtained using the sample. Unlike errors, which are theoretical and represent deviations from the true underlying model, residuals provide a practical estimate of these deviations, allowing us to assess the goodness of fit and identify any patterns or discrepancies in the model.\nIn essence, a residual serves as an estimate of the error. While errors represent the deviation from the actual true value, residuals reflect the discrepancy between observed data and the fitted model. From Figure 9.2 you can see the residual \\(e_i\\) of an i^th observation in a fitted regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Residual and a best fit line\n\n\n\nThe distance of \\(i^{th}\\) observation (\\(e_i\\)) from the fitted line can be considered as the residual (error). Best fit line can be obtained by minimizing this distance. This can be achieved using the mathematical technique “principle of least squares” discussed in Section 9.1.3. Before going to identify a best fit line on should know the concept of a straight line.\n\n\n9.1.2 Straight lines\nA straight line is the simplest figure in geometry. Mathematical equation of a straight line is\n\\[Y = \\alpha + \\beta X \\tag{9.1}\\]\nTwo important features of a line intercept (\\(\\alpha\\)) and slope(\\(\\beta\\)). \\(\\alpha\\) is the Y-intercept, the intercept of a line is the y-value of the point where it crosses the y-axis. \\(\\beta\\) is the slope of a line, which is a number that measures its “steepness”. It is the change in Y for a unit change in X along the line. In regression \\(\\beta\\) is called as regression coefficient explained in Section 9.1.4.\nIntercept and slope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Intercept of a straight line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Slope of a straight line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Intercept and slope\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) can be considered as a finger print of a line; with these values we can easily identify the line. So now our problem is simple, to find a line of best, estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), such that error ei of each observation is minimized. For that we use the method of least squares.\n\n\n9.1.3 Method of least squares\nOn considering the error term \\(e_i\\); equation of a straight line is\n\\[y_i = \\alpha +\\beta x_i + e_i \\tag{9.2}\\]\nWhere \\(e_i\\) is the ith error term corresponding to \\(y_i\\), i =1, 2, …, n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne way to obtain line of best fit is by estimating \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) by minimizing error sum \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{e_i}\\). By theorem \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{e_i} = 0\\). So \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are estimated by minimizing \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{e_i}^2\\). The term \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}e_i^2\\) is called as error sum of squares. As we are minimizing the sum of the squares of error term the process is known by the name principle of least squares.\n\n\nPrinciple of least squares\nPrinciple of least squares is the statistical method used to determine a line of best fit by minimizing the sum of squares of the error term i.e minimizing \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{e_i}^2\\).\nConsider Equation 9.2\n\\[y_i = \\alpha +\\beta x_i + e_i\\]\n\\[e_i = y_i -(\\alpha +\\beta x_i) \\tag{9.3}\\]\n\\[e_i^2 = [y_i -(\\alpha +\\beta x_i)]^2 \\tag{9.4}\\]\n\\[\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}e_i^2 = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}[y_i -(\\alpha +\\beta x_i)]^2 \\tag{9.5}\\]\nwe want to minimize Equation 9.5 and estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}e_i^2\\) can be minimized by taking derivative with respect to \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and equating to zero. On doing so we will get two equations, these equations are termed as normal equations and solving those normal equations will give the formulas for estimating \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nDifferentiating \\(E=\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}e_i^2\\) with respect to \\(\\alpha\\) and equating to 0.\n\\[\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2 \\left[ y_i - (\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right](-1) \\tag{9.6}\\]\n\\[= -2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i \\right] \\tag{9.7}\\]\nequating the derivative in Equation 9.7 to \\(0\\) and on simplifying:\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i \\right] = 0 \\tag{9.8}\\]\nexpand the summation in Equation 9.8:\n\\[=\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - n\\alpha - \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 \\tag{9.9}\\]\non rearranging Equation 9.9 you will get the first normal equation.\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i =n\\alpha + \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\tag{9.10}\\]\nDifferentiating \\(E=\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}e_i^2\\) with respect to \\(\\beta\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2 \\left[ y_i - (\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right](-x_i) \\tag{9.11}\\]\n\\[= -2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\left[ y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i \\right] \\tag{9.12}\\]\nequating the derivative in Equation 9.12 to \\(0\\) and on simplifying:\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\left[ y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i \\right] = 0 \\tag{9.13}\\]\nexpand the summation in Equation 9.13:\n\\[=\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = 0 \\tag{9.14}\\]\non rearranging Equation 9.14 you will get the second normal equation.\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i x_i = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\tag{9.15}\\]\nOn solving normal equations Equation 9.10 and Equation 9.15, we derive the equations to estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), which are considered population parameters. Since these parameters are usually unknown, we estimate them using equations derived from sample data. The estimated values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are denoted as \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), where the hats indicate that they are sample-based estimates. These are pronounced as “alpha cap” and “beta cap,” respectively, and are used as approximations of the true population parameters.\n\n\n9.1.4 Regression coefficient\nThe regression coefficient, \\(\\beta\\) in linear regression, represents the slope of the regression line. It quantifies the relationship between the independent variable (\\(x\\)) and the dependent variable (\\(y\\)). Specifically, \\(\\beta\\) indicates the expected change in \\(y\\) for a one-unit increase in \\(x\\), holding other factors constant. Regression coefficients can take any real value, ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\), depending on the nature of the relationship between the variables. A positive \\(\\beta\\) implies a direct relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) increases), while a negative \\(\\beta\\) implies an inverse relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases). A coefficient of \\(0\\) suggests no linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of \\(\\beta\\) reflects the strength of the association, with larger absolute values indicating stronger relationships. Equation 9.16 and Equation 9.16 for the calculation of estimate of \\(\\beta\\) is obtained by solving normal equations Equation 9.10 and Equation 9.15. Equation 9.16 can be used for hand calculations.\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}=\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}x_{i} - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}}}{n}}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}^{2} - \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} \\right)^{2}}{n}} \\tag{9.16}\\]\nEquation 9.16 can be written as\n\\[\\hat{\\beta} =\\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)} \\tag{9.17}\\]\n\n\n9.1.5 Intercept\nThe intercept, often denoted as \\(\\alpha\\) in linear regression, represents the value of the dependent variable \\(y\\) when the independent variable \\(x\\) is equal to zero. It is the point at which the regression line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis. The intercept provides a baseline value for the dependent variable before any influence from the independent variable is considered. The intercept can take any real value (\\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\)), and its meaning depends on the specific context of the data. In some cases, it may not have a practical interpretation, especially if \\(x = 0\\) is not within the range of observed data. Equation 9.18 for estimating \\(\\alpha\\) is obtained by solving normal equations Equation 9.10 and Equation 9.15.\n\\[\\hat{\\alpha} =\\overline{y}-\\hat{\\beta}.\\overline{x} \\tag{9.18}\\]\nwhere \\(\\overline{y}\\) = mean of \\(y\\); \\(\\overline{x}\\) = mean of \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOnce the estimates of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), which are denoted as \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) respectively are obtained using Equation 9.17 and Equation 9.18. The estimated regression line can be written as:\n\\[y =\\hat{\\alpha}+ \\hat{\\beta} x \\tag{9.19}\\]\n\n\n\n\n9.1.6 Assumptions\nThe goal of linear regression is to estimate the coefficients of the regression equation, which help explain how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable. However, for the results of a regression analysis to be reliable and meaningful, certain underlying assumptions must be met. These assumptions ensure that the estimates are accurate, the predictions are unbiased, and the conclusions drawn from the model are valid. Before conducting a regression analysis, it is crucial to understand and verify these assumptions to avoid misleading results.These assumptions are:\n\nLinearity\nThe relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is linear. This means that the changes in the dependent variable are proportional to changes in the independent variable(s).\nIndependence\nThe observations in the dataset are independent of each other. Additionally, the residuals (errors) are assumed to be independent.\nHomoscedasticity\nThe variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). In other words, the spread of the residuals should remain consistent and not show patterns of increasing or decreasing variance.\nNormality of residuals\nThe residuals (errors) are normally distributed. This is particularly important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. Normality assumption doesnot much influence the estimation of regression coefficient.\nNo multicollinearity\nIn the case of multiple regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other, as multicollinearity can distort the estimates of regression coefficients.\nNo autocorrelation\nThere should be no autocorrelation in the residuals. This means that the residuals of one observation should not be correlated with the residuals of another.\nCorrect model specification\nThe model should include all relevant variables and exclude irrelevant ones. The functional form of the relationship between variables should be correctly specified.\n\nViolations of these assumptions can lead to biased, inconsistent, or inefficient estimates, affecting the validity of the regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe essence of the assumptions in linear regression can be summarized as \\(e \\sim \\text{i.i.d.}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). This denotes that the errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), with a mean of zero and a constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Independence ensures that the error for one observation neither depends on nor influences the error for another. Identically distributed means that all errors are drawn from the same probability distribution, without variation across observations. A mean of zero ensures that the errors do not introduce systematic bias into the model’s predictions. Additionally, the constant variance (homoscedasticity) implies that the errors maintain a consistent level of variability across all values of the independent variable(s).",

Usually \\(\\beta\\) here is denoted as \\(\\beta_{yx}\\) and it is obtained using Equation 9.21.\n\\[\\beta_{yx} =\\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)} \\tag{9.21}\\]\nRegression of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\)\nConsider the two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), if you are considering \\(x\\) as dependent variable and \\(y\\) as independent variable then your equation is:\n\\[x = \\alpha_1 + \\beta_{xy}.x \\tag{9.22}\\]\nThis is used to predict the unknown value of variable \\(x\\) when value of variable \\(y\\) is known. Usually \\(\\beta\\) here is denoted as \\(\\beta_{xy}\\) and it is obtained using Equation 9.23.\n\\[\\beta_{xy} =\\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(y)} \\tag{9.23}\\]\nYou can see from Equation 9.21 and Equation 9.23 both the regression coefficients were different. It depends on the experimenter to choose dependent and independent variable. In the Example 8.2 there may be situation that considering moisture as dependent variable is meaningless, i.e. it depends on the fact that what is the usefulness in predicting soil moisture based on monetary crop yield?. So the selection of dependent and independent variable is entirely the discretion of experimenter based on the objective of his study.\n\n9.2.1 Properties of regression coefficients\n\nThe correlation coefficient between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) denoted as \\(r_{xy}\\) is the geometric mean of the two regression coefficients \\(\\beta_{yx}\\) and \\(\\beta_{xy}\\)\n\n\\[r_{xy} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{yx}.\\beta_{xy}} \\tag{9.24}\\]\n\nRegression coefficients are independent of change of origin but not of scale. Regression coefficients exhibit specific behaviors under transformations of the variables \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), particularly when there are changes in origin or scale. They are independent of a change in origin for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This means that adding or subtracting a constant to either variable (e.g., transforming \\(x\\) to \\(x'= x + c\\) or \\(y\\) to \\(y'= y + c\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant) does not affect the slope \\(\\beta\\) of the regression line. The slope depends on the relative differences between values, which remain unchanged by shifts in origin. However, changes in origin will affect the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) by adjusting it to accommodate the shift in \\(y\\). In contrast, regression coefficients are not independent of changes in scale. When either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is multiplied or divided by a constant (e.g., \\(x'= kx\\) or \\(y'= ky\\), where \\(k\\) is a non-zero constant), the slope \\(\\beta\\) changes proportionally. Specifically, the regression coefficient is inversely proportional to the scale factor for \\(x\\) because scaling affects the covariance and variance of the variables. Similarly, scaling \\(y\\) affects both the slope and the intercept, as the entire regression equation is scaled by the factor \\(k\\). Understanding these effects is crucial for accurately interpreting regression results, especially when transformations are applied during data preprocessing.\nIf one regression coefficient is greater than unity, then the other must be less than unity but not vice versa. i.e. both the regression coefficients can be less than unity but both cannot be greater than unity, i.e. if \\(\\beta_{yx} &gt;1\\) then \\(\\beta_{xy} &lt;1\\) and if \\(\\beta_{xy} &gt;1\\), then \\(\\beta_{yx} &lt;1\\).\nAlso if one regression coefficient is positive the other must be positive (in this case the correlation coefficient is positive) and if one regression coefficient is negative the other must be negative (in this case the correlation coefficient is negative). This relationship arises because the regression coefficients and the correlation coefficient share the same sign, reflecting the direction of the association between the two variables.\nThe range of regression coefficients is \\(- \\infty\\) to \\(+ \\infty\\).\nIf the variables (\\(x\\) ) and (\\(y\\)) are independent, the regression coefficients are zero. This is referred to as the independence property of regression coefficients.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Properties of regression lines\n\nRegression lines minimize the sum of squared deviations of observed values from the predicted values, ensuring the best possible fit.\nThe regression lines intersect at the mean values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) i.e., at (\\(\\overline{x}\\),\\(\\overline{y}\\))\nThe slopes of the regression lines are related to the correlation coefficient r. If r=0, the lines are perpendicular, indicating no linear relationship.\n\nThe position of regression lines is closely related to the strength of the correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). As shown in Figure 9.5, the placement of the two lines changes with the correlation value, demonstrating how the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) influences the regression line’s position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) When correlation = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect positive correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Perfect negative correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) High degree positive correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) High degree negative correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Low degree negative correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Low degree positive correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Effect of correlation strength on the position of regression lines",

It allows researchers to account for the combined effect of multiple factors on an outcome, making it particularly useful in agricultural research.

Fitting a model means estimating \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) using equation.\nAfter fitting the model put 20 in the \\(x\\) value you will get the predicted \\(y\\) value\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Calculation table for regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSl No. \n\n\nSoil moisture (\\(x\\))\n\n\nCrop yield in Rs(\\(y\\))\n\n\n\\((x_{i}-\\overline{x})\\)\n\n\n\\((y_{i}-\\overline{y})\\)\n\n\n\\((x_{i}-\\overline{x})(y_{i}-\\overline{y})\\)\n\n\n\\((x_{i}-\\overline{x})^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n215\n\n\n-4.48\n\n\n-187.42\n\n\n838.69\n\n\n20.03\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n325\n\n\n-2.28\n\n\n-77.42\n\n\n176.12\n\n\n5.18\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n185\n\n\n-6.78\n\n\n-217.42\n\n\n1473.00\n\n\n45.90\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n15.2\n\n\n332\n\n\n-3.48\n\n\n-70.42\n\n\n244.70\n\n\n12.08\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n406\n\n\n-0.18\n\n\n3.58\n\n\n-0.63\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n22.1\n\n\n522\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n119.58\n\n\n409.57\n\n\n11.73\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n412\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n9.58\n\n\n6.95\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n25.1\n\n\n614\n\n\n6.43\n\n\n211.58\n\n\n1359.42\n\n\n41.28\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n23.4\n\n\n544\n\n\n4.73\n\n\n141.58\n\n\n668.98\n\n\n22.33\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n18.1\n\n\n421\n\n\n-0.58\n\n\n18.58\n\n\n-10.69\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n22.6\n\n\n445\n\n\n3.93\n\n\n42.58\n\n\n167.14\n\n\n15.41\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n17.2\n\n\n408\n\n\n-1.48\n\n\n5.58\n\n\n-8.24\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\nSUM\n\n\n224.1\n\n\n4829\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n5325.03\n\n\n176.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(n\\) =12\n\\[mean,\\overline{x} = \\ \\frac{224.1}{12} = 18.675\\]\n\\[mean,\\overline{y} = \\ \\frac{4829}{12} = 402.416\\]\n\\[cov (x,y) =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)\\left( y_{i} - \\overline{y} \\right)} = \\frac{5325.03}{12} = 443.752\\]\nvariance of \\(x\\):\n\\[var\\left( x \\right) = \\ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{176.983}{12} = 14.7485\\] now using Equation 9.17\n\\[\\hat{\\beta} =\\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}\\]\n\\[\\hat{\\beta} =\\frac{443.752}{14.7485} =30.088\\] using Equation 9.18\n\\[\\hat{\\alpha} =\\overline{y}-\\hat{\\beta}.\\overline{x}\\]\n\\[\\hat{\\alpha} = 402.416 - 30.088\\left( 18.675 \\right) = \\  - 159.477\\]\nSo our estimated model is\n\\[y = \\  - 159.477 + 30.088x\\]\n\\[\\text{crop yield in Rs} =- 159.477 + 30.088\\text{(soil moisture)}\\]\nfor soil moisture content at 20%, i.e. \\(x = 20\\)\n\\[y = \\  - 159.477 + 30.088(20)\\] = 442.28\nSo the predicted monetary yield in rupees at a average soil moisture of 20% is \\(442.283\\)",

While both techniques examine how variables relate to one another, they differ in their purpose, interpretation, and methodology. Correlation focuses on measuring the strength and direction of an association between two variables, without assuming causation. In contrast, regression goes a step further by modeling the relationship, enabling predictions of one variable based on the other(s).

While studying the heights of parents and their children, Galton noticed a fascinating pattern: tall parents tended to have slightly shorter children, and shorter parents tended to have slightly taller children. He called this phenomenon “regression toward the mean”, as the offspring’s heights seemed to move closer to the population average. This observation not only introduced the term “regression” but also inspired the development of statistical tools for studying relationships between variables. Galton’s work, later expanded by Karl Pearson, laid the foundation for modern regression analysis, which remains an essential technique in several fields ranging from agriculture to space exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“Statistics is the art of never having to say you’re wrong”:-Robert P.

    "text": "10.1 Random experiment\nProbability is a cornerstone of statistical methods, providing the mathematical framework to quantify and analyze uncertainty. In the diverse and dynamic field of agricultural research, uncertainty often arises in areas such as yield predictions, pest control strategies, and the impact of environmental variables on crop growth. Understanding probability equips researchers and students with the tools to make informed decisions in the face of variability and randomness.\nThis chapter introduces fundamental probability concepts. We begin with the basic definitions and axioms of probability. The chapter progresses to explore key topics such as conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem, and independence of events.\nA random experiment is a process or procedure that produces an outcome which cannot be predicted with certainty beforehand. The outcome is determined by chance, and the set of all possible outcomes is known as the sample space. Random experiments form the basis of probability theory and are critical for understanding uncertainty in various contexts.\nCharacteristics of a random experiment\nSome common examples of random experiments used to illustrate probability theory were discussed below:\nTossing a coin\nTossing a coin is one of the simplest and most fundamental random experiments used to illustrate the principles of probability. Despite its simplicity, this seemingly mundane activity provides profound insights into random processes and lays the groundwork for understanding more complex probabilistic systems.\nWhen a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes:\nWe say that for an unbiassed coin the probability of the coin landing \\(H\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and the probability of the coin landing \\(T\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\nThrowing dice\nA standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. Under fair conditions, each face has an equal probability of appearing when the die is rolled. Thus, the probability of getting any one face is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\nPlaying cards\nA standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards, divided into four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, with each suit containing 13 cards. Four suits in playing cards were given in the Figure 10.2. The spades suit includes 9 numbered cards from 2 to 10, along with the picture cards ace, king, queen, and jack. Similarly, the hearts, diamonds, and clubs suits each contain 13 cards. Of these 52 cards, 26 are red, consisting of the hearts and diamonds suits, while the other 26 cards are black, comprising the spades and clubs suits. Playing cards can be used to create examples for random experiments, such as drawing a single card from a shuffled deck to determine its specific identity. Other experiments include drawing a card and checking its suit etc. These simple experiments can be easily modified with conditions or repetition, making playing cards a versatile tool for exploring probability and random events.",

    "text": "10.3 Probability\nProbability is a measure of the likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur. It quantifies uncertainty and is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. Mathematically, the probability of an event \\(A\\) is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely, and is given by\nProbability of an event \\(A\\) happening:\n\\[p(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} \\tag{10.1}\\]\nhere favourable outcome means outcomes favouring the happening of event \\(A\\).\nExample 10.1: What is the chances of rolling a “4” with a die ?\nSolution 10.1: Let the event \\(A\\) = rolling a “4” with a die. Number of ways event \\(A\\) can happen is one, as there is only 1 face with a “4” on it. Total number of outcomes is 6 (there are 6 faces altogether). So using Equation 10.1; probability,\\(p(A)\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\nExample 10.2: There are 5 marbles in a bag: 4 are blue, and 1 is red. What is the probability that a blue marble gets picked?\nSolution 10.2: Let the event \\(A\\) = a blue marble gets picked. Number of ways event \\(A\\) can happen is 4 (there are 4 blues). Total number of possible outcomes is 5 (there are 5 marbles in total). So using Equation 10.1; probability,\\(p(A)\\) = \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) = 0.8\nCommon terms used\nOutcome: An outcome is the result of a random experiment, representing a single occurrence or observation. For instance, when rolling a die, the outcomes could include the appearance of 1 dot, 2 dots, and so on.\nSample space: The sample space (denoted as \\(S\\)) of a random experiment is the set that contains all possible outcomes of that experiment. For example, when tossing a coin, the sample space is \\(S\\) = {H, T}, and when throwing a die, the sample space is \\(S\\) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nSample point: A sample point is an individual element of the sample space, representing a single possible outcome.

    "section": "10.4 Event",
    "text": "10.4 Event\nAn event refers to one or more outcomes of a random experiment. It can represent any subset of the sample space, where the event consists of specific outcomes that are of interest in the context of the experiment. An event can be a single outcome. For example, when tossing a coin, getting a “Tail” is an event that represents just one outcome from the sample space {H, T}. Similarly, rolling a “5” on a die is an event that includes only one specific outcome, 5, from the sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nOn the other hand, an event can also include multiple outcomes. For instance, when selecting a “king” from a deck of cards, the event includes any one of the four kings (king of hearts, king of diamonds, king of clubs, king of spades), forming a set of four possible outcomes. Similarly, when rolling an “even number” on a die, the event would encompass the outcomes {2, 4, 6}, which are all the even numbers in the sample space of a die roll. Thus, an event can be a single outcome or a combination of multiple outcomes depending on the context of the experiment.\nExample 10.3: Ram wants to see how many times a “double” (both dice have same number) comes up when throwing 2 dice.\nSolution 10.3: The sample space is all possible outcomes (36 Sample Points): {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} … {6,3} {6,4} {6,5} {6,6}. The event Ram is looking for is a “double”, where both dice have the same number. It is made up of these 6 sample points: {1,1} {2,2} {3,3} {4,4} {5,5} and {6,6}. You can calculate the probability of the event using Equation 10.1. Probability = \\(\\frac{6}{36}=0.17\\).\n\n10.4.1 Types of events\nIndependent events\nIndependent events are events where the occurrence of one does not influence the occurrence of another. For instance, consider tossing a coin. If it lands on “heads” three times in a row, the outcome of the next toss remains unaffected by the previous results. The probability of getting “heads” on the next toss is still \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (or 0.5), just as it is for any fair coin toss. This demonstrates that past outcomes do not influence the probabilities of future events in independent scenarios.\nExample 10.4: A coin is tossed 100 times, and heads appear in 99 of those tosses. What is the probability that heads will appear on the \\(100^{th}\\) toss?\nSolution 10.4: Answer is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as each toss is independent of previous toss.\nDependent events\nDependent events are events where the outcome of one event influences the probabilities of subsequent events. For example, consider drawing cards from a deck. The probabilities change as cards are removed from the deck, altering the available outcomes. Initially, the chance of drawing a king on the first card is \\(\\frac{4}{52}\\). However, for the second draw, the probabilities depend on the outcome of the first draw. If the first card is a king, only 3 kings remain among the 51 remaining cards, reducing the likelihood of drawing another king to \\(\\frac{3}{51}\\). Conversely, if the first card is not a king, all 4 kings remain, making the probability \\(\\frac{4}{51}\\). This illustrates how previous outcomes affect probabilities in dependent events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen cards are drawn with replacement, each card is returned to the deck after being drawn, so the total number of cards remains constant. This keeps the probabilities unchanged, making the events independent. However, when cards are drawn without replacement, the total number of cards decreases after each draw, which alters the probabilities and makes the events dependent.\n\n\nMutually exclusive events\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. It is either one event or the other, but not both. For example, turning left or right is mutually exclusive because you cannot do both simultaneously. Similarly, heads and tails in a coin toss is mutually exclusive. Drawing a king and drawing an ace are mutually exclusive events because you can’t draw both in a single card. However, not all events are mutually exclusive. For instance, kings and hearts are not mutually exclusive because it is possible to have a king of hearts, an outcome that belongs to both categories.\nExhaustive events\nA set of events is called exhaustive if, together, they encompass the entire sample space. For example, when tossing a die, the sample space is \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Consider the events: event \\(A\\), which is getting an even number \\(\\{2, 4, 6\\}\\), and event \\(B\\), which is getting an odd number \\(\\{1, 3, 5\\}\\). These events are exhaustive because, when combined, they include all possible outcomes in the sample space.\nEqually likely events\nEqually likely events are events that have the same theoretical probability of occurring. For example, when tossing a coin, event \\(A\\) (getting a head) and event \\(B\\) (getting a tail) are equally likely events because both have an equal probability of occurring.",

    "section": "10.5 Definitions of probability",
    "text": "10.5 Definitions of probability\nIn probability theory, different approaches are used to define and calculate the likelihood of events occurring. These approaches vary depending on the nature of the experiment and the available information. The three primary definitions of probability are mathematical (classical), statistical (empirical), and axiomatic, each offer unique perspectives and methods for determining probabilities. The classical approach is based on equally likely outcomes, the empirical approach relies on experimental data, and the axiomatic approach, developed by A.N. Kolmogorov, is based on a set of foundational principles. Understanding these definitions helps in applying probability theory to various real-world situations, from simple experiments to more complex scenarios.\n\n10.5.1 Mathematical approach\nIt is also known as classical, theoretical or a priori approach to probability. If an experiment with \\(n\\) exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes, \\(m\\) outcomes are favourable to the happening of an event \\(E\\), the probability \\(p\\) of happening of E is given by\n\\[p\\left( E \\right) = \\ \\frac{m}{n} \\tag{10.2}\\]\n\\(p\\) is termed as probability of success.\nExample 10.5: When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes head or tail. Outcomes are exhaustive, mutually exclusive and equally likely. What is the probability of getting head?\nSolution 10.5: Solution using mathematical approach, consider the event \\(E\\) : getting a head; probability of event \\(E\\), \\(p(E)\\) can be determined using Equation 10.2.\nhere, number of outcomes are favourable to the happening of event \\(E\\), \\(m =1\\); \\(n\\) = total number of possible outcomes (head and tail) = 2\n\\[p\\left( E \\right) =  \\ \\frac{1}{2}\\]\ni.e. probability of getting a head is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\nLimitations\nThe mathematical approach has certain limitations. For instance, it cannot account for situations where the outcomes are not equally likely, such as tossing a biased die. Additionally, this approach cannot define probability when the total number of possible outcomes \\(n\\) is unknown or tends to infinity, as in determining the probability of raining tomorrow. To address these limitations, other definitions of probability have been developed.\n\n\n10.5.2 Statistical approach\nThe statistical approach to probability, also known as the empirical approach, is based on observing and recording outcomes from repeated experiments. The probability of an event is determined as the ratio of the number of times the event occurs \\(m\\) to the total number of trials \\(n\\) as when \\(n\\) approaches infinity. This method is useful when theoretical probabilities cannot be calculated but relies on the practicality of conducting a large number of trials and assumes consistency in experimental conditions.\nThe probability \\(p\\) of happening of \\(E\\) is given by\n\\[p\\left( E \\right) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{m}{n} \\tag{10.3}\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of times the process is performed which tends to infinity, and \\(m\\) is the number of times the outcome ‘\\(E\\)’ happens.\nLimitations\nThe statistical approach also has limitations. In some cases, the experiment may not be practically repeatable, making it impossible to rely on repeated trials. Additionally, it raises the question of how large (\\(n\\)) must be to provide a good approximation of the probability. To address these issues, Russian mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov introduced the axiomatic approach, which does not rely on precise definitions but instead establishes probability based on a set of fundamental axioms or postulates.\n\n\n10.5.3 Axiomatic Approach\nThe axiomatic approach to probability, introduced by A.N. Kolmogorov, provides a formal framework based on a set of foundational axioms rather than specific definitions. This approach overcomes the limitations of earlier methods by establishing universally accepted rules that apply to all probability calculations, making it applicable to a wide range of theoretical and practical scenarios.\nWhole field of probability theory is based on the following three axioms\n\nProbability of an event, \\(p(E)\\) lies between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). That is \\(0 \\leq p(E) \\leq 1\\)\nProbability of entire sample space is 1. That is \\(p\\left( S \\right) = 1\\)\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive events then probability of occurrence of either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is denoted by \\(p(A \\cup B)\\) shall be given by \\(p\\left( A \\cup B \\right) = p\\left( A \\right) + p(B)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe probability \\(p\\) of the occurrence of an event is referred to as the probability of success, while the probability \\(q\\) of its non-occurrence is known as the probability of failure. Both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are non-negative and cannot exceed unity, i.e., \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\) and \\(0 \\leq q \\leq 1\\). This means the probability of an event always lies between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), inclusive. The probability of an impossible event is \\(0\\), and the probability of a certain event is \\(1\\). For instance, if \\(p(A) = 1\\), event \\(A\\) is guaranteed to occur, and if \\(p(A) = 0\\), event \\(A\\) cannot occur. Additionally, the number of favorable outcomes \\(m\\) for an event cannot exceed the total number of outcomes \\(n\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Probability always lies between 0 and 1\n\n\n\nExample 10.6: In a simultaneous toss of two coins, find the probability of (i) getting 2 heads.

Four outcomes are there with sum 9, they are (5,4), (6,3), (3,6), (4,5). \\(p (A) = \\frac{4}{36} =\\frac{1}{9}\\)\nExample 10.8: From a bag containing 10 red, 4 blue and 6 black balls, a ball is drawn at random. What is the probability of drawing (i) a red ball? (ii) a blue ball? (iii) not a black ball?\nSolution 10.8: There are 20 balls in all.

    "text": "10.6 Event relations\nIn probability theory, relationships between events help in analyzing their combined or individual outcomes within a sample space. These relations include concepts such as union, intersection, complement and mutual exclusivity, which are fundamental for understanding how events interact and influence probabilities.\nComplement of an event\nIn probability, the complement of an event refers to all outcomes in the sample space that are not favorable to the given event. If \\(A\\) is an event, its complement is denoted by \\(A^c\\), and it represents the occurrence of all outcomes where \\(A\\) does not happen.\nFor example, consider the experiment of tossing a die. Let \\(A\\) be the event of getting an even number. The favorable outcomes for \\(A\\) are \\(\\{2, 4, 6\\}\\). The remaining outcomes, \\(\\{1, 3, 5\\}\\), do not satisfy \\(A\\) and are therefore the complement of \\(A\\). These outcomes represent the occurrence of \\(A^c\\), where \\(A\\) does not occur, therefore in this case \\(A^c=\\{1, 3, 5\\}\\) .\nThe complement of an event is essential in probability calculations and is related to the event by the formula:\n\\[P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \\tag{10.4}\\]\nThe relationship in Equation 10.4 highlights that the probability of an event and its complement together always sum to 1. i.e. \\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\\)\nEvent \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nDenoted as ‘\\(A \\cup B\\)’, spelled as \\(A\\) union \\(B\\), represents the occurrence of either event \\(A\\), event \\(B\\) or both.

The outcomes 2, 4 and 6 are favourable to the event \\(A\\) and the outcomes 3 and 6 are favourable to the event \\(B\\) i.e. \\(A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\), \\(B= \\{3, 6\\}\\) then \\(A \\cup B = \\{ 2, 3, 4, 6\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Venn diagram showing union of two events\n\n\n\nEvent \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nDenoted as ’ \\(A \\cap B\\) ’ spelled as \\(A\\) intersection \\(B\\), represents the occurrence of both events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) simultaneously. It includes only those outcomes that are common to both events. For example, on throwing a die in which \\(A\\) is the event of getting a multiple of 2 and \\(B\\) is the event of getting a multiple of 3. The outcomes favorable to \\(A\\) are 2, 4, 6 and the outcomes favorable to \\(B\\) are 3 and 6. Here 6 is present in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so here \\(A \\cap B = 6\\).

It provides a systematic way to understand and quantify the probabilities of different occurrences.\nProbability, as a measure of uncertainty, helps us analyze various phenomena. For instance, when rolling a die, the possible outcomes and their likelihoods are described by a probability distribution. Such distributions apply to any random experiment where outcomes are uncertain or unpredictable.\nIn this chapter, we explore the definition, functions, formulas, and types of probability distributions.\nIn simple terms, a probability distribution is a way to represent all possible outcomes of a random variable, along with their corresponding probabilities. To understand this better, let us consider a random experiment—tossing an unbiased coin three times. Let \\(X\\) represent the number of heads that appear in these tosses. The possible outcomes for \\(X\\) are 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, and 3 heads, forming the sample space \\(X = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\). However, these outcomes are not equally likely. The total number of possible outcomes when tossing the coin three times is 8, as shown in Table 11.1.\n\\(P(X = x)\\) = \\(\\frac{No: \\ of \\ times\\ X\\ takes\\ value\\ x}{8}\\)\n\\(P(X = 3)\\) = 1/8; \\(P(X = 2)\\) = 3/8; \\(P(X = 1)\\) = 3/8; \\(P(X = 0)\\) = 1/8\nTable 11.2 below shows the probability distribution of the number of heads that appear on tossing a coin 3 times.\nThis is an example of discrete probability distribution as \\(X\\) takes only discrete values.

It’s the average you’d see over countless rolls, even though you can’t roll a 3.5! The expected value of a random variable \\(X\\) is denoted as \\(E(X)\\).\nThe formula for calculating the Expected Value of random variable where there are multiple probabilities is given for discrete and continuous in Equation 11.1 and Equation 11.2.\nDiscrete case {.underline}\n\\[E(X) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty}xP(x) \\tag{11.1}\\]\nContinuous case {.underline}\n\\[E(X) = \\int_{- \\infty}^{\\infty}{x P(x)\\ \\text{dx }};- \\infty \\leq x \\leq \\infty \\tag{11.2}\\]\nhere the random variable \\(X\\) lies between \\({-\\infty}\\) and \\({+\\infty}\\)\nExample 11.1: Find Expected value of \\(X\\) of tossing a single unfair die\n\n\n\nTable 11.3: Expected value of an unfair die\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n\n\np(x)\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 11.1:\n\n\n\nTable 11.4: Solution: Expected value of an unfair die\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxp(x)\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing equation Equation 11.1, \\(E(X)\\) = \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{6}xP(x)\\) = 0.1+0.2+0.3+0.4+0.5+3 = 4.5\nExample 11.2: Find E(X) in the following case (solve it yourself)\n\n\n\nTable 11.5: Find the expected value\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(P(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n1/8\n\n\n1\n3/8\n\n\n2\n3/8\n\n\n3\n1/8",

    "section": "11.3 Discrete probability distributions",
    "text": "11.3 Discrete probability distributions\nA discrete probability distribution represents the probabilities of outcomes of a discrete random variable, which takes on a countable number of distinct values. For example, the number of heads when flipping a coin three times or the number of defective items in a batch are described by discrete distributions. Each possible outcome is assigned a specific probability, and the sum of these probabilities is always 1.\nWe have seen that a probability distribution lists all possible outcomes of a random variable along with their corresponding probabilities, often represented as a table. However, it is often more convenient to express the distribution as an equation. With such an equation, the probability corresponding to any given value of \\(x\\) can be calculated directly. Depending on the situation, various discrete probability distributions are used to model different scenarios. In this chapter, we will focus on the following discrete distributions.\n\nBernoulli distribution\nBinomial distribution\nPoisson distribution\n\nProbability mass function\nWhen a probability function is used to describe a discrete probability distribution, it is referred to as a probability mass function (commonly abbreviated as p.m.f). A probability mass function assigns a probability to each specific outcome of a discrete random variable. It is expressed as: \\(P(x) = P(X = x)\\). Here, \\(X\\) is the discrete random variable, and \\(P(x)\\) represents the probability of \\(X\\) taking the specific value \\(x\\). The function ensures that all probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1 across all possible outcomes of \\(X\\).\nProperties of p.m.f\n\nThe probability of each outcome is always non-negative. For a discrete random variable \\(X\\) and its p.m.f, \\(P(x) \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x\\)\nThe sum of the probabilities over all possible values of the random variable equals 1. That is:\\(\\sum_{x \\in S} P(x) = 1\\). where \\(S\\) is the sample space of (\\(X\\)), representing all possible values.\nThe p.m.f gives the exact probability for each specific value of the discrete random variable. For a value \\(x:P(X = x) = P(x)\\)\nIf a value \\(x\\) is not in the sample space \\(S\\), its probability is zero: \\(P(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\notin S\\)\n\nThe p.m.f is defined only for the discrete values in the sample space of the random variable \\(X\\). It does not apply to continuous ranges or non-discrete variables.\n\n11.3.1 Bernoulli distribution\nA Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that applies to a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, commonly referred to as “success” and “failure.” For example, tossing a coin results in two outcomes, which the experimenter can label as success and failure based on their context. Success might be defined as getting a head and failure as getting a tail. The definition of success and failure is flexible and can be tailored by the experimenter to suit the specific scenario under study.\nThe probability mass function of the distribution is\n\\[P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x} \\tag{11.3}\\]\nin Equation 11.3 \\(X\\) takes only two values = 0,1. Where \\(p\\) is the probability of success and \\(1-p\\) is the probability of failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA parameter of a distribution is a fixed value that describes a key characteristic of the distribution. The parameter of a Bernoulli distribution is \\(p\\), which represents the probability of success in a single trial\n\n\nThe expected value for a random variable, \\(X\\), from a Bernoulli distribution is: E(\\(X\\)) = \\(p\\) and the variance of a Bernoulli random variable is: var(\\(X\\)) = \\(p(1 - p)\\).\nExample 11.3: Find the probability assuming Bernoulli distribution of a biased coin where probability of success (getting head) \\(p\\) = 0.4\nSolution 11.3: Let \\(X\\) be the random variable which takes value 0 on getting tail (failure) and takes value 1 on getting head (success). So using the equation Equation 11.3\n\\(P(X = 0) = (0.4)^0 (1-0.4)^1 = 0.6\\)\n\\(P(X = 1) = (0.4)^1 (1-0.4)^0 =0.4\\)\nthe distribution can be shown as below:\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(P(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.6\n\n\n1\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA Bernoulli trial is one of the simplest experiments you can conduct in probability and statistics. It’s an experiment where you can have one of two possible outcomes. For example, “Yes” and “No” or “Heads” and “Tails.”\n\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Binomial distribution\nBinomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a success or failure outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times; i.e. a Binomial distribution happens, when a Bernoulli trial is repeated \\(n\\) number of times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice). For example, if you toss a coin 5 times and count the number of heads, that count, \\(X\\), follows a binomial distribution with \\(n = 5\\). In short, a single coin toss is a Bernoulli trial, but repeating it several times (more than once) turns it into a binomial experiment.\nBinomial distributions must also meet the following three criteria:\n\nThe number of observations or trials (\\(n\\)) is fixed.\nEach observation or trial is independent\nThe probability of success(\\(p\\)) is exactly the same from one trial to another\n\nThe probability mass function of the distribution is\n\\[P(x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x q^{n-x} = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} p^x q^{n-x} \\tag{11.4}\\]\nwhere x takes values = 0,1,2,…, \\(n\\)\n\\(n\\)= number of trials\n\\(x\\)= number of success desired\n\\(p\\)= probability of getting a success in one trial\n\\(q\\) = \\(1-p\\) = probability of getting a failure in one trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a binomial distribution, the parameters are \\(n\\), the number of independent trials, and \\(p\\), the probability of success in a single trial. If X follows a binomial distribution we denote \\(X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)\\). The mean of \\(X\\) is given by \\(E(X) = np\\), while the variance is \\(\\text{Var}(X) = npq\\), where\\(q = 1 - p\\). Since \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\), it follows that \\(q\\) is also positive but less than 1. This implies that \\(np &gt; npq\\), establishing the fundamental property that the mean of a binomial distribution is always greater than its variance.\n\n\nExample 11.4: A coin is tossed 10 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 6 heads?\nSolution 11.4: here, \\(n = 10; x = 6; p = \\frac{1}{2}; q = 1-p = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nWe have to find \\(p(X=6)\\); using the Equation 11.4\n\\(p(X=6)=\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{6}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{10 - 6} = 0.2050\\)\n\n\n11.3.3 Poisson distribution\nThe Poisson distribution, discovered by the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840), was developed to describe the number of times a gambler would win a rarely won game of chance over a large number of tries. As a discrete probability distribution, it specifically deals with rare events. One of its earliest applications was in studying the number of deaths caused by horse kicks in the Prussian army, demonstrating its usefulness in modeling infrequent occurrences over a given interval of time or space.\nOther applications and examples where Poisson distribution is used\n\nPest incidence\nBirth defects and genetic mutations\nRare diseases\nCar accidents\nTraffic flow and ideal gap distance\nNumber of typing errors on a page\nHairs found in McDonald’s hamburgers\nSpread of an endangered animal in Africa\nFailure of a machine in one month\n\nA random variable \\(X\\) is said to follow a Poisson distribution; if it assumes non-negative values and its probability mass function is given by:\n\\[p\\left( X = x \\right) = \\frac{e^{- \\lambda}.\\lambda^{x}}{x!} \\tag{11.5}\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) = 0,1,2,… ., \\(\\infty\\),\n\\(e\\) = Is the base of the natural logarithm. It is a constant approximately equal to 2.71828.\n\\(\\lambda\\) : Average number of successes occurring in a given time interval or region in the Poisson distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameter of Poisson distribution is \\(λ\\). If X follows a Poisson distribution we denote \\(X \\sim \\text{poisson}(\\lambda)\\). The mean and the variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\nExample 11.5: The average number of homes sold by a Realty company is 2 homes per day. Assuming Poisson distribution what is the probability that exactly 3 homes will be sold tomorrow?\nSolution 11.5: here \\(\\lambda = 2\\); since 2 homes are sold per day, on average.\\(x= 3\\); since we want to find the probability that 3 homes will be sold tomorrow. Using Equation 11.5.\n\\(p(X=3)= \\ \\frac{{2.71828}^{- 2}{\\  \\times \\ 2}^{3}}{3!}= 0.180\\)\nExample 11.6: If the random variable X follows a Poisson distribution with mean 3.4, find \\(p(X = 6)\\)\nExample 11.7: The number of industrial injuries per working week in a particular factory is known to follow a Poisson distribution with mean 0.5. Find the probability that in a particular week there will be: (a) Less than 2 accidents (b) More than 2 accidents\nExample 11.8: A company known on the past experience that 3% of the bulbs they produced are defective. Assuming Poisson distribution find the probability of getting the following in a sample of 100 bulbs. (a) No defective (b) 1 defective",

    "section": "11.4 Continuous probability distributions",
    "text": "11.4 Continuous probability distributions\nIf the random variable X is continuous, the corresponding probability distribution is termed as continuous probability distribution. There are several continuous distributions. Our discussion is limited to only Normal distribution.\nProbability density function\nWhen a mathematical function is used to describe a continuous probability distribution, it is referred to as a probability density function (commonly abbreviated as p.d.f). It describes how values of a continuous random variable are distributed. It gives the relative likelihood of a variable taking a particular value within a given range. The area under the pdf curve over an interval represents the probability that the variable falls within that range. However, unlike pmf for discrete variables, the pdf itself does not give the probability of a single value but rather the density of possible values.\n\n11.4.1 Normal distribution\nThe name “normal distribution” comes from its historical use in describing many natural and social phenomena that appeared to follow a similar symmetric, bell-shaped pattern. The term “normal” was popularized by Karl Pearson in the early 20th century, though the distribution itself was first studied by Abraham de Moivre and later formalized by Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nThe distribution was initially called the Gaussian distribution, as Gauss used it to model errors in astronomical observations. However, statisticians and scientists noticed that this pattern frequently appeared in various real-world data, such as heights, IQ scores, and measurement errors. Because it was so common, it became known as the normal distribution, implying that it represents a “normal” or typical way data is distributed in many natural processes.\nIt is characterized by its symmetric, bell-shaped curve, where the mean, median, and mode are equal. Defined by two parameters, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). Its significance lies in the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends to be normally distributed, making it widely applicable in statistical inference. The normal distribution is defined by the following probability density function.\n\\[f\\left( x \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}}e^{- \\frac{{(x - \\mu)}^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}} \\tag{11.6}\\]\n, where \\(- \\infty &lt; x &lt; + \\infty\\) ; \\(μ\\) is the population mean and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance, \\(e = 2.718\\)\nParameters of Normal distribution\nAs with any probability distribution, the parameters of the normal distribution define its shape and probabilities entirely. The normal distribution has two parameters, mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). The normal distribution does not have just one form. Instead, the shape changes based on the parameter values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Shape changes in normal distribution based on different means\n\n\n\nStandard deviation:\nThe standard deviation is a measure of variability. It defines the width of the normal distribution. It determines how far away from the mean the values tend to fall. It represents the typical distance the observations and the average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Shape changes in normal distribution based on different standard deviation\n\n\n\nWhen you have normally distributed data, the standard deviation can be used to determine the proportion of the values that fall within a specified number of standard deviations from the mean. For example, in a normal distribution, 68% of the observation falls within \\(\\mu\\pm  \\sigma\\). This property is called as Area Property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameters of normal distribution are \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). If a random variable \\(X\\) follows the normal distribution, then we write \\(X\\sim\\text{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\). In particular, the normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 =1\\) is called the standard normal distribution, and is denoted as \\(X\\sim\\text{N}(0,1)\\)\n\n\nProperties of Normal distribution\n\nThe normal distribution is the most frequently used among all probability laws. The normal distribution can be found in many practical problems. If you plot density \\(f(x)\\) against \\(x\\) the graph will be bell shaped always.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Normal distribution curve\n\n\n\n\nThe Normal Distribution has mean = median = mode. Mean, median and mode is located to the center of the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Mean=Median=Mode in normal distribution\n\n\n\n\nNormal distribution is symmetric about the center, 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Normal distribution is a symmetric distribution\n\n\n\n\nArea Property\nThe area property of the normal distribution shows how data is spread around the mean. As we move further from the mean, more values are included within the range. For example, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. The area increases as we expand the range to two or three standard deviations, covering 95% and 99.7% of the data, respectively. See Table 11.6 for detailed information on the area property of the normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Area property of normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.6: Area property of normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nArea\n\\(\\%\\) of value contained\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 0.745\\sigma\\)\n50\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm \\sigma\\)\n68.26\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 1.96\\sigma\\)\n95\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\\)\n95.44\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 2.58\\sigma\\)\n99\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma\\)\n99.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, a normal distribution is bell-shaped, symmetric, and has the property that the mean, median, and mode are all equal. It also has the area property. Other important properties of the normal distribution are listed below:\n\nDefined by two parameters: The normal distribution is fully defined by its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), where \\(\\mu\\) determines the center and \\(\\sigma\\) determines the spread or width of the curve.\nTotal area under the curve: The total area under the normal distribution curve is equal to 1, representing the total probability of all possible outcomes.\nAsymptotic: The tails of the normal distribution approach, but never actually touch, the horizontal x-axis. This means the probability of extreme values is never exactly zero, but it becomes infinitesimally small.\nSkewness and Kurtosis: A normal distribution has skewness equal to 0 (no skew), and kurtosis equal to 3 (mesokurtic), meaning it has a moderate peak and tails.\nLinear combination: A linear combination of independent normal variables is also normally distributed. This property is crucial in statistical analysis and is a key reason for the widespread use of the normal distribution.\nCentral Limit Theorem: The normal distribution is central to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean will tend to be normal regardless of the shape of the original distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.\nMoments: All odd order moments are zero in normal distribution.\nDispersion: Quartile Deviation. Q.D = \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma\\) and Mean Deviation. M.D = \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Standard Normal distribution\nThe standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This distribution is also known as the Z-distribution. In the standard normal distribution, a value is referred to as a standard score or Z-score. The Z-score indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\nA normal distribution can be converted to a standard normal distribution, which provides several advantages:\n\nSimplifies calculations: With a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, performing statistical calculations becomes more straightforward.\nUniversal comparison: Converting to a standard normal distribution allows comparison between different normal distributions on a common scale, regardless of their original means and standard deviations.\nZ-scores: The conversion enables the calculation of Z-scores, which measure the relative position of a data point in terms of standard deviations from the mean.\nConsistent analysis: It allows the use of standard normal distribution tables, making probability calculations more accessible and consistent across different datasets.\n\nTo convert a normal variate to a Standard Score (“z-score”)\n\nFirst subtract the mean,\nThen divide by the Standard Deviation\n\nAnd doing that is called “Standardizing”.\nWhen a normal variate $ X N(, ^2)$ is converted to a standard normal variate, it follows the transformation:\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\tag{11.7}\\]\nHere, \\(X\\) is a normal variate with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and \\(z\\) is the corresponding standard normal variate. This transformation converts \\(X\\) into a standard normal distribution \\(z \\sim N(0, 1)\\), where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Standardization of normal distribution\n\n\n\nExample 11.6: A survey of daily travel time (\\(X\\)) had these results (in minutes): 26, 33, 65, 28, 34, 55, 25, 44, 50, 36, 26, 37, 43, 62, 35, 38, 45, 32, 28, 34. Convert it in to standard scores (Z-score).\nSolution 11.6: The Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is 38.8 minutes, and the Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 11.4.

This indicates that 27 is +1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\n\n11.4.3 Z-Score Table\nA Z-score table (or standard normal distribution table) shows the cumulative probability for a standard normal distribution, corresponding to different Z-scores. It provides the probability that a standard normal variable will be less than or equal to a given value. A model Z score table is given Figure 11.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Z-score table\n\n\n\nProcedure to use a Z-Score Table is given below:\n\nCalculate the Z-score:\nFirst, calculate the Z-score using the formula Equation 11.7\nFind the Z-score in the table:\nOnce you have the Z-score, locate its value in the Z-score table Figure 11.9. The table typically lists Z-scores in two parts: the first two digits (the ones and tenths place) are listed on the left, and the second decimal place is listed at the top. For example, for a Z-score of 1.23, find 1.2 on the left side and 0.03 across the top, and the value at the intersection is the cumulative probability.\nInterpret the table value:\nThe value from the Z-table represents the cumulative probability (area under the curve) to the left of the Z-score. For example A Z-score of 1.23 corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.8907, which means there is an 89.07% chance that a value from the distribution is less than or equal to 1.23 standard deviations above the mean.\nUse the table for finding areas:\nTo find the probability that a value lies above a certain Z-score, subtract the table value from 1. For example, if the Z-score is 1.23, the probability of a value being greater than 1.23 is: \\(P(z &gt; 1.23) = 1 - 0.8907 = 0.1093\\). So, there is a 10.93% chance the value is above 1.23 standard deviations.\nFor ranges of Z-scores:\nIf you’re looking for the probability that a value falls between two Z-scores, find the cumulative probabilities for both Z-scores and subtract the smaller from the larger. For example, for Z-scores of 1.23 and 0.5. From the table the cumulative probability for 1.23 is 0.8907. The cumulative probability for 0.5 is 0.6915. The probability that \\(X\\) lies between 0.5 and 1.23 is:\\(P(0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.23) = 0.8907 - 0.6915 = 0.1992\\). By following these steps, you can use the Z-score table to find cumulative probabilities and interpret standard normal distribution data.\n\nExample 11.8: Average yield of mango trees in an orchard has a mean of 70kg and with a standard deviation of 12kg. What is the probable percentage of mango trees with yield more than 85kg?\nSolution 11.8: The z score for the given data using Equation 11.7 is \\(z = \\frac{85 - 70}{12}=1.25\\). From the z score table Figure 11.9, the fraction of the data within this score is 0.8944. This means 89.44 % of the trees are within the yield of 85kg and hence the percentage of trees with yield above 85kg = (100-89.44)% = 10.56 %.\nExample 11.9: The heights of coconut trees, H metres, are Normally distributed with a mean of 14.5 and a variance of 7 . Determine the probability that the height of a randomly chosen tree will be less than 12 metres.\nSolution 11.9: Let H be the height of the tree. It is given that \\(H \\sim N(14.5,7)\\). We nee to find \\(P(H &lt; 12)\\). Which can be standardized to \\(P(z &lt; \\frac{12 - 14.5}{\\sqrt{7}})\\)= \\(P(z &lt; -0.9442)\\). Since normal distribution is symmetric, \\(P(z &lt; -0.9442)=P(z &gt; 0.9442)\\). \\(P(z &gt; 0.9442)= 1-P(z \\leq 0.9442)\\). From the table \\(P(z \\leq 0.95) =0.8289\\) so the probability is 1-0.8289=0.171.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Insights\n\n\n\nDe Moivre’s Final Prediction\nAbraham de Moivre, a French mathematician exiled to England, spent his life uncovering the hidden patterns of probability. Among his greatest contributions was the normal distribution, the elegant bell-shaped curve that governs everything from human traits to measurement errors. As he aged, de Moivre observed that his daily sleep was increasing by about 15 minutes, and in a striking prediction, he calculated that on the day his sleep reached 24 hours, he would die. Mysteriously, his forecast came true—he passed away on November 27, 1754. Though eerie, his work on probability lived on, later refined by Gauss and Laplace, shaping the foundation of modern statistics and proving that even randomness follows a predictable order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“To understand God’s thoughts, we must study statistics, for these are the measure of his purpose.” — Florence Nightingale",
