# Regression Analysis  

Regression analysis is the method of using observations (data records)
to quantify the relationship between a target variable also referred to
as a *dependent variable*, and a set of *independent variables*.

## Definition

Regression analysis is a mathematical measure of the average
relationship between two or more variables in terms of the original
units of the data.

## Simple regression

When only two variables are involved; Regression can be defined as the
functional relationship between two variables, where one may represent
cause and the other may represent effect. The variable representing
cause is known as independent variable and is denoted by 'X'. The
variable 'X' is also known as predictor variable, regressor or
explanatory variable. The variable representing effect is known as
dependent variable and is denoted by Y. For example consider yield and
fertilizer dose, here yield can be considered as dependent variable (Y)
and fertilizer dose can be considered as independent variable (X).

## Two types of variables

In regression analysis the variable whose values need to be predicted
(Y) is called **dependent variable** and the variable which is used for
prediction (X) is called **independent variable.**

When more than two independent variables are present then the regression
is called as **Multiple Regression**. If only two variables are present
then it is called as **simple regression**.

## Detailed explanation

Correlation is a statistical measure which determines the degree of
association of two variables. Regression on other hand side describes
how an independent variable is numerically related to dependent
variable.

Regression can be simply defined as a technique of fitting best line or
line of best fit to estimate value of one variable on the basis of
another variable. Now what is a best line? or line of best fit?

For explaining further, consider the example of Ice cream sales:

**Example 8.1**: The local ice cream shop keeps track of how much ice
cream they sell versus the temperature on that day; here are their
figures for the last 12 days:

| Temperature (°C) | Ice Cream Sales (in \$) |
|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| 14.2             | 215                     |
| 16.4             | 325                     |
| 11.9             | 185                     |
| 15.2             | 332                     |
| 18.5             | 406                     |
| 22.1             | 522                     |
| 19.4             | 412                     |
| 25.1             | 614                     |
| 23.4             | 544                     |
| 18.1             | 421                     |
| 22.6             | 445                     |
| 17.2             | 408                     |

We can use regression analysis to answer the following questions

What will be the Ice cream sales when temperature is 20^o^ Celsius?

What is the functional form of relationship between Temperature and Ice
cream sales?

```{r r1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Scatter diagram of data in Example 8.1',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r2.jpeg"))
```

We can draw a line to denote the functional relationship between
temperature and sales

```{r r2, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='lines drawn to show functional relationship',out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r99.png"))
```

You can see that as shown above we can draw any number of lines, so
which is the best fit line?

We can say the **best fit line** is the line that passes through all
points such that distance of each point to the line is minimum. Using
regression technique we could easily draw such a line. Before proceeding
you should know the concept of error and residuals.

## Error and residual

An error is the difference between the observed value and the true value
(true value is the unobserved population mean of the population from
which sample observations are taken). A residual is the difference
between the observed value and the predicted value (by the model
**fitted line**). Error cannot be measured but residual can be; so
residual is considered as an estimate of error.

```{r r3, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Error depicted in best fit line ',out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r91.png"))
```

The distance of each observation (*e*~i~) from the fitted line can be
considered as the residual (error). Best fit line can be obtained by
minimizing this distance. This can be achieved using the mathematical
technique "**principle of least squares**".

## Straight lines

A straight line is the simplest figure in geometry.

Mathematical equation of a straight line Y= ***a*** + ***b***X.

Two important features of a line **slope** and **intercept**. ***a*** is
the Y-intercept, the intercept of a line is the y-value of the point
where it crosses the y-axis. ***b*** is the **slope of a line,** which
is a number that measures its "steepness". It is the change in Y for a
unit change in X along the line. In regression ***b*** is called as
regression coefficient.

Intercept (***a***)

```{r r4, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Intercept of a line ',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r92.png"))
```

Slope (***b***)

```{r r5, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Slope of a line ',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r93.png"))
```

***a*** and ***b*** can be considered as a finger print of a line; with
these values we can easily identify the line.

So now our problem is simple, to find a line of best, estimate ***a*** &
***b***, such that error *e*~i~ of each observation is minimized. For
that we use the **method of least squares**.

## Method of least squares

On considering the error term *e*~i~; equation of a straight line is

*y*~i~=*a*+*bx*~i~+*e~i~*;

Where *e~i~* is the *i*^th^ error term corresponding to *y*~i~, *i*
=1,2,\...,*n*

Line of best fit can be obtained by estimating ***a*** and ***b*** by
minimizing error sum 'Σ*e~i~'*. By theorem Σ*e~i~ =*0; so ***a*** and
***b*** are estimated by minimising Σ*e~i~* ^2^

## Principle of least squares

The statistical method used to determine a line of best fit by
minimizing the sum of squares of the error term Σ*e~i~* ^2^

*y~i~*=*a*+*bx*~i~+*e~i~*;

*e~i~ =* *y*~i~ -- (*a*+*bx*~i~)

*e~i~*^2^ = {*y*~i~ -- (*a*+*bx*~i~)}^2^

**Σ***e~i~*^2^ = **Σ** {*y*~i~ -- (*a*+*bx*~i~)}^2^

**Σ***e~i~*^2^ is called as error sum of squares. As we are minimizing
error sum of squares, hence the name principle of least squares.

We want to minimize, **E = Σ***e*~i~^2^ = **Σ** {*y*~i~ --
(*a*+*bx*~i~)}^2^

*i*.*e*. we need to find ***a*** and ***b*** such that **E** is minimum

**E** can be minimized by taking derivative with respect to ***a*** and
***b*** and equating to zero. On doing so we will get two equations,
these equations are termed as **normal equations** and solving those
normal equations will give the formula for ***a*** and ***b***.

We are not discussing calculation part here. After taking derivatives we
will get two equations (Normal equations) as below:

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i} = n\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}}$$

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}x_{i} = \mathbf{a}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} + \mathbf{b}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}$$

On solving the above equations we will get

Regression coefficient,
$$b=\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}x_{i} - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_{i}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}}}{n}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}^{2} - \frac{\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} \right)^{2}}{n}}$$

$$=\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}$$

$$\mathbf{b =}\frac{\mathbf{cov(x,y)}}{\mathbf{var(x)}}
$$

$$\mathbf{a = }\overline{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{- b}\overline{\mathbf{x}}$$

where $\overline{y}$ = mean of *y*; $\overline{x}$ = mean of *x*

## Two lines of regression

There are two lines of regression- that of *y* on *x* and *x* on *y*.

[Regression of *y* on *x*]{.underline}

Consider the two variables *x* and *y*, if you are considering *y* as
dependent variable and *x* as independent variable then your equation
is:

***y*** **= *a* + *bx***

This is used to predict the unknown value of variable *y* when value of
variable *x* is known. Usually ***b*** here is denoted as ***b***~yx~

$$\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{\text{yx}}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{cov(x,y)}}{\mathbf{var(x)}}$$

Consider Example 8.1; considering ice cream sales as dependent variable
and temperature as independent variable

```{r r6, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Scatter diagram of data in Example 8.1',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r7.jpeg"))
```

[Regression of *x* on *y*]{.underline}

Consider the two variables *x* and *y*, if you are considering *x* as
dependent variable and *y* as independent variable then your equation
is:

***x*****= *c* + *my;*** where ***c*** is the intercept and ***m*** is
the slope

This is used to predict the unknown value of variable *x* when value of
variable *y* is known. Usually ***b*** here is denoted as ***b***~xy~

$$\mathbf{b}_{\mathbf{\text{xy}}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{cov(x,y)}}{\mathbf{var(y)}}$$

Consider Example 8.1; considering temperature as dependent variable and
ice cream sales as independent variable

```{r r7, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Scatter diagram of data in Example 8.1',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/r8.jpeg"))
```

You can see both the regression were different. It depends on the
experimenter to choose dependent and independent variable. In the above
example it is evident that considering temperature as dependent variable
is meaningless, *i*.*e*. what is the usefulness in predicting
temperature based on ice cream sales?. So the selection of dependent and
independent variable is entirely the discretion of experimenter based on
the objective of his study.

## Assumptions of Regression

If *y* is the dependent variable and *x* is the independent variable
then

1.  The *x*'s are non-random or fixed constants.

2.  At each fixed value of *x* the corresponding values of *y* have a
    normal distribution about a mean.

3.  For any given *x*, the variance of *y* is same.

4.  The values of *y* observed at different levels of *x* are completely
    independent.

## Properties of Regression coefficients

1.  The correlation coefficient between *x* and *y* is the geometric
    mean of the two regression coefficients ***b***~yx~ and ***b***~xy~

$$r = \sqrt{b_{\text{yx}}b_{\text{xy}}}$$

2.  Regression coefficients are independent of change of origin but not
    of scale.

3.  If one regression coefficient is greater than unity, then the other
    must be less than unity but not vice versa. *i*.*e*. both the
    regression coefficients can be less than unity but both cannot be
    greater than unity, *i*.*e*. if ***b***~yx~ \>1 then ***b***~xy~ \<1
    and if ***b***~xy~ \>1, then ***b***~yx~ \<1.

4.  Also if one regression coefficient is positive the other must be
    positive (in this case the correlation coefficient is positive) and
    if one regression coefficient is negative the other must be negative
    (in this case the correlation coefficient is negative).
    
5.  The range of regression coefficients is $- \infty$ to $+ \infty$.

6.  If the variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, the regression coefficients are zero. This is referred to as the independence property of regression coefficients.

## Uses of Regression

**Prediction**: The regression analysis is useful in predicting the
value of one variable from the given value of another variable. Such
predictions are useful when it is very difficult or expensive to measure
the dependent variable, Y.

**Identify the strength of relationship**: The regression might be used
to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variable(s)
have on a dependent variable. Like the strength of relationship between
dose and effect, sales and marketing spending, or age and income.

**Forecast effects or impact of changes**: That is, the regression
analysis helps us to understand how much the dependent variable changes
with a change in one or more independent variables. A typical question
is, "how much additional sales income do I get for each additional 1000
spent on marketing.

**Predicts trends and future values**: The regression analysis can be
used to predict trend and future values, like "what will be the price of
gold in 6 months?"

## Properties of Regression lines

1.  Regression lines minimize the sum of squared deviations of observed values from the predicted values, ensuring the best possible fit.

2.  The regression lines intersect at the mean values of 
𝑋and𝑌 *i.e.,* at ($\overline{X}$,$\overline{Y}$)

3.  The slopes of the regression lines are related to the correlation coefficient r. If r=0, the lines are perpendicular, indicating no linear relationship.

## Example problem

Now consider the example 8.1 and answer the questions

| Temperature (°C) | Ice Cream Sales (in \$) |
|:-----------------|:------------------------|
| 14.2             | 215                     |
| 16.4             | 325                     |
| 11.9             | 185                     |
| 15.2             | 332                     |
| 18.5             | 406                     |
| 22.1             | 522                     |
| 19.4             | 412                     |
| 25.1             | 614                     |
| 23.4             | 544                     |
| 18.1             | 421                     |
| 22.6             | 445                     |
| 17.2             | 408                     |

1.  What is the functional form of relationship between Temperature and
    Ice cream sales?

2.  What will be the Ice cream sales when temperature is 20^o^ Celsius?

**Solution**

1.  Fit a model considering Ice cream sales as dependent variable (*y*)
    and temperature as independent variable (*x*). Fitting a model means
    estimating ***b*** and ***a*** using equation.

2.  After fitting the model put 20 in the *x* value you will get the
    predicted *y* value

Model: *y* = ***a***+***b**x*

```{r ex85, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt<-read.csv("csv/Book12.csv")
colnames(dt) <- c("Sl No.", "Temperature (x)", "Sales (y)", "$(x_{i}-\\overline{x})$","$(y_{i}-\\overline{y})$ ", "$(x_{i}-\\overline{x})(y_{i}-\\overline{y})$", "$(x_{i}-\\overline{x})^2$")
kable(dt,escape = FALSE) %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")%>%
kable_styling(position="center",bootstrap_options = c("striped"))%>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, align = "c")
```

*n* =12

$$mean,\overline{x} = \ \frac{224.1}{12} = 18.675$$

$$mean,\overline{y} = \ \frac{4829}{12} = 402.416$$

*Cov* (*x*,*y*) =
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)\left( y_{i} - \overline{y} \right)}$$

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{12}{\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)\left( y_{i} - \overline{y} \right)} = 5325.03$$

$$Cov (x,y) = \frac{5325.03}{12} = 443.752$$

$$variance\ of\ x,\ var\left( x \right) = \ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{2} = \frac{176.983}{12} = 14.7485$$

$$\mathbf{b =}\frac{\mathbf{cov(x,y)}}{\mathbf{var(x)}}$$

$$\mathbf{b =}\frac{443.752}{14.7485}\mathbf{=}30.088$$

$$\mathbf{a =}\overline{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{- b}\overline{\mathbf{x}}$$

$$\mathbf{a =}402.416 - 30.088\left( 18.675 \right) = \  - 159.477$$

So our model is

$$y = \  - 159.477 + 30.088x$$

$$Ice\ cream\ sales = \  - 159.477 + 30.088(Temperature)$$

Ice cream sales when temperature is 20^o^ Celsius

$$x = 20$$

$y = \  - 159.477 + 30.088(20)$ = 442.283

So the predicted ice cream sales at 20^o^ Celsius is **442.283**
